Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.15.0:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load cray-stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

HPE Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) 16.0.0
===========================================

Release Date:
-------------
May 2023


Purpose:
--------
CCE 16.0.0 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for
HPE Cray supercomputer and HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems.


Key Changes and Support with CCE 16.0.0:
----------------------------------------

CCE 16.0.0:
-----------
 - LLVM 16 base
 - RHEL gcc-toolset-10 support/integration
      - On RHEL, CCE uses headers and libraries from RHEL gcc-toolset-10 instead of
        cray-gcc-10.3.0; other operating systems are unchanged
 - OpenMP 5.0 full support, including the following new features:
      - taskloop cancellation (Fortran)
      - conditional lastprivate (Fortran)
      - "if" clause on "simd" constructs (Fortran)
      - iterators in "depend" clauses (Fortran)
      - depend objects (Fortran)
      - task reductions (Fortran)
      - non-rectangular loop collapse (Fortran) - functional
      - inclusive and exclusive scan operations (Fortran)  - functional
      - "declare mapper" (Fortran) - limited
      - "loop" construct (C/C++) - limited
 - Optimized OpenMP GPU parallelism mapping policy
      - "omp teams" still maps to GPU coarse-grained parallelism (threadblocks or work groups)
      - "omp parallel" now maps to GPU fine-grained parallelism (threads or work items)
      - "omp simd" can still map to fine-grained parallelism (Fortran only)
 - TCMalloc is removed in Fortran
      - CCE no longer provides TCMalloc as an option replacement for the GLIBC
        allocator.  The related Fortran options (-htcmalloc/-hsystem_alloc) have been
        removed.
 - Tuned Support for AMD Genoa
 - Grace SVE Support
 - DWARF5 Enhancements
      - Support for split DWARF
      - Support for compressed DWARF
      - Support for inline functions to depth 1
      - Beta support for variables in OpenMP regions that are offloaded to AMD GPU


User and Application Impact:
----------------------------

CCE 16.0.0:
-----------

On RHEL, CCE 16 uses headers and libraries from RHEL gcc-toolset-10. Prior
versions of CCE use headers and libraries from cray-gcc-10.3.0. Binaries built
with prior versions of CCE may need to be rebuilt. Users who are not using the
RHEL operating system are unaffected.

While the optional tcmalloc allocator provided a significant performance boost to some
multi-threaded applications, many third-party libraries and tools expect applications
to use the glibc allocator and do not work or work well with it so CCE is no longer
providing it.  Users who still wish to use it will need to build it themselves.



Issues or Bugs Resolved:
------------------------
CCE 16.0.0:
-----------

CAST-29703 CCE - internal compiler error
CAST-30549 LAMMPS CCE build failure when perftools or perftools-lite are loaded

CAST-32450 Pointer variables and class dummy variables fails with ACC: find_in_present_table failed for 'XXX (dope vector)'
CAST-32458 The DART application gives wrong answers when compiled with CCE
CAST-32485 Tioga - CCE 15.0.1 fails with Assertion `DwarfReg    >   = 0 && "Invalid dwarf register number"' failed compiling E3SM HIP source with -O0 -g - Elevation of Case 5372060962
CAST-32612 crayftn reports an error for recursive elemental procedures.
CAST-32040 Cray Compiler OpenACC - Hundreds of .acc.s and .acc.o files left after compiling

Product and OS Dependencies:
----------------------------
 This CCE release is supported on
 - HPE Cray supercomputer systems running CSM with COS 2.4.X or COS 2.5.X (SLES15 SP4)
 - HPE Cray supercomputer systems running HPCM with SLES15 SP4
 - HPE Cray supercomputer systems running HPCM with RHEL 8.6
 - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems running RHEL 8.6
 - AMD GPU offloading support requires at least ROCm 5.0 (tested up to ROCm 5.4.3)




Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
 - The OpenACC type `acc_handle_kind` has been changed to be of size 8 bytes (instead of 4 bytes). This will require recompilation of any codes that use this type.
 - Linking Fortran applications may fail with an error message of the form "hidden symbol `<SYMBOL>' in <LIB> is referenced by DSO".
   If this error message is seen, it can usually be worked around by adding '-lgcc_s' to your link line.  This is known to affect use
   of craypat and cray-parallel-netcdf but may be seen without them as well.

    * PyTorch v1.10

Documentation:
--------------
  For more information see the intro_dl_plugin man pages.

Known Issues:
-------------

  * Using Tensorflow 1.14 binaries distributed by Google and Intel require portions of the DL
    Plugin to be compiled with gcc 4.8. If using the included source distribution of the
    DL Plugin to install the Python packagesinto a given Python installation, gcc 4.8
    will need to be used to install said packages, assuming Google and Intel distributed
    Tensorflow 1.14 binaries are used. For TensorFlow 1.15 and greater, use of gcc 7.x
    is required instead.

Craypkg-gen 1.3.28
==============

Release date
------------
   October 2022

Purpose
-------
   Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed in this release
--------------------------
   - Remove lmod dynamic dierachy setup from intel-mixed.lua
   - Fix compiler environment variables in nvhpc lua modulefiles

Dependencies
------------
   The craypkg-gen 1.3.28 release is supported on the following HPE
   Cray systems:
   - Cray XC/XE/XK systems with CLE version 5.2 or later.
   - Cray EX systems SLE 15.0 or later and RHEL 8.0 or later.

   Driver support for integrating Third Party C, C++, and Fortran libraries
   through .pc files using pkg-config is used in CrayPE 2.x and later.


Limitation
----------
   - Library dependencies for static libraries are not added to the .pc files
       for keywords Requires.private and Libs.private. A warning is issued by
       the craypkg-gen tool to advise users to add this information to the
       libraries .pc files.
   - RPM limits packages to 4GB

Documentation
-------------
   Man pages for craypkg-gen are found by executing `module load craypkg-gen`
   and then `man craypkg-gen`. See
   http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config
   introduction.

   Examples for creating modulefiles for Intel, PGI and Python are included in
   the craypkg-gen ‘doc’ directory:

    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.28/doc/intel_example.txt
    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.28/doc/pgi_example.txt
    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.28/doc/python_example.txt

Example:

   - As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.
     After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
     this release by executing the following commands:

         # module load craypkg-gen
         # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210

     This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the
     command:

         # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210

Installation instructions
-------------------------

    rpm -ivh craypkg-gen-1.3.28-*-1.sles15sp4.202211162055.debb889235937.x86_64.rpm

   To change the product version to default after installation:

    /opt/cray/pe/admin-pe/set_default_files/set_default_craypkg-gen_1.3.28

Product description
-------------------

   The craypkg-gen 1.3.28 utility provides the system administrator
   a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack.
   Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
   Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs.

   The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
   1) Build the open source software
   2) Create .pc files for libraries
   3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
   4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
   5) Package rpms
   6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) 2.18.0:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Changelog:
---------
CTI 2.17.1 (PE 22.12) contains a new feature, file deduplication, for
Slurm and PALS workload managers. If enabled, CTI will run a check on
compute nodes to determine if files can be excluded from the shipped
package. This can significantly improve application startup time.
To enable, set the environment variable CTI_DEDUPLICATE_FILES=1.

NOTE:
Race condition workaround for PALS 1.2.3 in CTI 2.17.0 (22.11)

In PALS 1.2.3, there is a race condition between the tool launcher releasing a
job from the startup barrier and the job actually getting to the startup
barrier. This can result in the job receiving the startup barrier release
signal before it actually arrives there, resulting in the job getting stuck
in the barrier. As a workaround, the environment variable CTI_PALS_BARRIER_RELEASE_DELAY
can be set to add a delay between job startup and barrier release. If set to a
positve integer n, CTI will wait n seconds between starting a job and releasing
it from the barrier on PALS. A delay as small as one second works in most cases.

gdb4hpc 4.15.0:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

IOBUF 2.0.10:
============

Release Date:
-------------
  June 2020

Product Description:
--------------------
  IOBUF is an I/O buffering library that can reduce the I/O wait time
  for programs that read or write large files sequentially. IOBUF
  intercepts I/O system calls such as read and open and adds a layer of
  buffering, thus improving program performance by enabling asynchronous
  prefetching and caching of file data.

Purpose:
--------
  The following bugs are fixed in the iobuf 2.0.10 release.
    CAST-7645  can load multiple iobuf module versions
    CAST-19029 cray iobuf fwrite does not work
    CAST-20732 Out of memory caused by fflush+close instead of fclose

Known problems:
---------------
  The iobuf "direct" option causes Fortran sequential, unformatted I/O 
  to fail on CLE 5.0 and later systems.  For more information,
  please see PE-15003, "Fortran sequential writes fail with 
  IOBUF direct option on Lustre 2.x".

Operating System Dependencies:
------------------------------
  The IOBUF release is supported on 
  - Cray XC systems running CLE 6.0 or later operating systems
  - Cray Shasta systems

Cray LibSci 23.05.1.4
=====================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    May 2023


  Purpose:
  --------
    Cray LibSci 23.05.1.4 provides scientific libraries for Cray
    HPC systems. Cray LibSci is supported on the host CPU but
    not on the accelerator of these systems.

    The Cray LibSci 23.05.1.4 release provides the following:

    * support for RHEL gcc-toolset-10
    * Fix for CAST-32270
    * Fix for CAST-31665
    * Compiler and dependency updates

    Cray LibSci 23.05.1.4 includes the following versions of publicly
    available libraries:
      * LAPACK 3.10.1 - For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/lapack
      * ScaLAPACK 2.2.0 - (Scalable LAPACK) For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/scalapack.
      * QDWH 2.0.0 KSVD 1.0.0 - Polar decomposition and SVD packages, see
          https://github.com/ecrc/qdwh
          https://github.com/ecrc/ksvd
     

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------

    The Cray LibSci 23.05.1.4 release requires the following:
        SLE 15 or RHEL 8   
        craype/2.7.3 or later
        cray-mpich/8.1.0 or later

      One or more of the following compiler major versions:
        CCE 15.x, 16.x
        GCC 10.x, 11.x, 12.x (SLES)
	gcc-toolset-10.3.1-1 (RHEL)
        AOCC 3.x, 4.x
        AMD ROCm 5.x
        Intel 2023.x
        Nvidia 22.x

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

LibSci_ACC 23.05.1.1
====================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    May 2023

  Purpose and Misc:
  -----------------
    The Cray LibSci_ACC 23.05.1.1 release provides accelerated versions of
    scientific libraries for Cray systems with AMD MI100 or MI200 targets.

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 23.05.1.1 requires the following platform:

      HPE Cray EX system with AMD MI100 or MI200 support

    Cray LibSci_ACC 23.05.1.1 also requires:

      For SLES rpms:
         CCE 14.0 or later
         AMD ROCm 5.0 or later
         Cray MPICH 8.1.15 or later
         Cray LIBSCI 22.08 or later
      For RHEL rpms:
         CCE 16.0 or later
         AMD ROCm 5.0 or later
         Cray MPICH 8.1.26 or later
         Cray LIBSCI 23.05 or later

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 23.05.1.1 supports AMD MI100 and MI200 targets.

    LAPACK workspace calculations from other implementations or hard-coded
    values may not be compatible with libsci_acc.  Workspaces reported from
    a query to the corresponding libsci_acc function should be used.

    The current supported usecase is a one-rank to one-gpu mapping for apps.

    Performance improvements can be achieved in programs calling libsci_acc
    subroutines by using pinned memory. See the intro_libsci_acc man page for
    details.

    Use of the aprun option "-cc none" or the srun option "--cpu_bind=none"
    to disable core affinity is strongly suggested to maintain performance.

    When using non-default cray-libsci_acc versions users should set equivalent
    at runtime and linktime after loading the desired cray-libsci_acc module:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  Documentation:
  --------------------------------
    See the intro_libsci_acc man page for additional information.

  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci_acc

  Sample Installation instructions:
  ---------------------------------
    Rpm install command:

      rpm -ivh cray-libsci-acc-23.05.1.1-*.x86_64.rpm

    The "*" in the install command represents compiler version combinations.

Cray MPICH 8.1.26:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  May 24, 2023


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.26 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.26 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:
      - Starting from the 8.1.26 release, Cray MPICH supports the Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU HBM 
        processor architecture.

      - On systems with AMD GPUs, Cray MPICH 8.1.26 supports all ROCm
        versions starting from ROCm 5.0, including the latest ROCm 5.5.0 
        release. 
 
        The Cray MPICH 8.1.25 release and prior versions of 
        Cray MPICH are only compatible with ROCm versions up to (and 
        including) the ROCm 5.4.0 release.

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

MRNET 5.1.0
===============

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  MRNet is a customizable, high-performance software infrastructure for
  building scalable tools and applications.  It supports efficient 
  multicast and data aggregation functionality using a tree of processes 
  between the tool's front-end and back-ends.  MRNet-based tools may use 
  these internal processes to distribute many important tool activities, 
  for example to reduce data analysis time and keep tool front-end loads 
  manageable.

  MRNet-based tool components communicate across logical channels called
  streams. At MRNet internal processes, filters are bound to these streams to
  synchronize and aggregate dataflows. Using filters, MRNet can efficiently
  compute averages, sums, and other more complex aggregations and analyses
  on tool data. MRNet also supports facilities that allow tool developers
  dynamically load new tool-specific filters into the system.

Perftools 23.05.0
===============
 Release Date: May, 2023

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for the following systems:
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with HPCM
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with CSM
   - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen 10 Plus Systems (x86)

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o Support for ROCm 5.4 and 5.5.1
  o Upgrade to DWARF 0.6.0
  o Upgrade to ELF 0.8.15
  o Upgrade to PAPI 7.0.0.2
      - Upstream bugfixes
      - Upstream ROCm component version locked and renamed Cray ROCm
      - Deprecation of Cray CUDA component
      - Initial support for AMD Genoa processor
  o Update AMD GPU counter groups to align with ROCm 5.4
  o Support for Nvidia A100 counter collection
  o Update Nvidia counter groups for V100 & A100 GPUs
  o Remove support for P100 (Pascal), and older, Nvidia GPUs
  o Update CPU counter groups for AMD processors
  o Update HIP/HSA, HDF5, Charm++/Converse, PetSc, Lustre and CUDA
    trace groups to their latest versions
  o Replace the SHMEM tracegroup with SHMEMX, a superset
  o Support for PAT_region_push/pop in default callstack mode
  o Perftools and its libraries are now compiled using the native
    RHEL gcc and no longer depend on cray-gcc

 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o Segfaults when tracing certain HIP codes in full-trace mode
  o An issue parsing pat_opts compilation options
  o Invalid address ranges for some OMP target accelerator regions
    resulting in missing data
  o Inability to access non-qualified Cassini events
  o Runtime failures due to inability to locate Perftools DSOs
  o Missing calltree data for some programs executed with pat_run
  o Over-counting of HIP kernel launches when pruning is disabled
  o Python profiling: pat_run will search 'PATH' for the python command
    Example: 'pat_run python3 main.py'
  o Python profiling: various improvements to python pat_report output

 Notes:
 ======
  o This release of Perftools supports ROCm 5.4 and 5.5.1
  o The Charm++/Converse trace group is deprecated and will be removed
    in an upcoming release

 Known Issues:
 =============
  o A known bug in ROCProfiler 5.4 results in missing or incorrect metric
    instances on some AMD GPUs. Perftools' collection and reporting of
    accelerator performance counters and counter groups may fail as a result.
  o The predefined counter groups for AMD MI200 series GPUs were reduced to
    align with what is available in ROCm 5.4. When using ROCm 5.5.1, users can
    re-expand the counter groups by making use of the counter group files from
    prior releases.
  o Fortran applications compiled against CCE 16 may fail during instrumentation
    with the following error message: "hidden symbol `<SYMBOL>' in <LIB> is
    referenced by DSO". To work around this error specify the following during
    the pat_build invocation '-Dlink-instr=-lgcc_s'.
  o When PAT_RT_CALLSTACK_MODE=unwind is set, deadlocks have been observed 
    intermittently during startup of certain GPU-based codes. Rerunning the
    program generally resolves the issue. Alternatively, unset
    PAT_RT_CALLSTACK_MODE if the libunwind functionality is not required. 
 
 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (such as evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    Perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.

Sanitizers4hpc 1.1.0:
=========================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
Sanitizers4hpc is a debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
and errors in parallel applications. Using LLVM's AddressSanitizer or
LeakSanitizer as a data source, Sanitizers4hpc aggregates any duplicate
messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
program behavior.

Changelog:
---------
NOTE:
Shared library exposure in previous versions of sanitizers4hpc.

Previous versions of sanitizers4hpc incorrectly exported internal sanitizers4hpc
libraries into /opt/cray/pe/lib64, causing other programs that had that path in
their runpath or LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load libraries they didn't expect.

This has been fixed in the 22.08 release of sanitizers4hpc. However, links will
be present in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing to older versions of sanitizers4hpc,
if an older version is installed because old installations will still modify /opt/cray/pe/lib64 when ldconfig is run.

To clean up libraries left by previous versions of sanitizers4hpc:
Option 1:
  1. Uninstall all previously installed versions of sanitizers4hpc, or remove
     the .cray_dynamic_file_list file from all previously installed versions
     of sanitizers4hpc, typically installed in /opt/cray/pe/sanitizers4hpc.
  2. Remove any links in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing into a sanitizers4hpc installation.
  3. run ldconfig
Option 2:
  1. Uninstall all previous versions of santizers4hpc.

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Valgrind4hpc is a Valgrind-based debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
  and errors in parallel applications. Valgrind4hpc aggregates any duplicate
  messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
  program behavior. Valgrind4hpc manages starting and redirecting output from many
  copies of Valgrind, as well as deduplicating and filtering Valgrind messages.
  If your program can be debugged with Valgrind, it can be debugged with
  Valgrind4hpc.
