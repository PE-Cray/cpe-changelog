Product and OS Dependencies:
----------------------------
 This CCE release is supported on
 - HPE Cray supercomputer systems running CSM with COS 2.5.X (SLES15 SP4) or COS 23.11 (SLES15 SP5)
 - HPE Cray supercomputer systems running HPCM with COS 2.5.X (SLES15 SP4) or COS 23.11 (SLES15 SP5)
 - HPE Cray supercomputer systems running HPCM with RHEL 8.7
 - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems running RHEL 8.7
 - AMD GPU OpenMP and OpenACC offloading support requires at least ROCm 6.0 (AMD GPU HIP offloading can still use ROCm 5.x)


Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
 - The OpenACC type `acc_handle_kind` has been changed to be of size 8 bytes (instead of 4 bytes). This will require recompilation of any codes that use this type.
 - Linking Fortran applications may fail with an error message of the form "hidden symbol `<SYMBOL>' in <LIB> is referenced by DSO".
   If this error message is seen, it can usually be worked around by adding '-lgcc_s' to your link line.  This is known to affect use
   of craypat and cray-parallel-netcdf but may be seen without them as well.
 - There is a known bug in the CUDA header `cuda_fp16.h` detailed in the upstream issue https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60296.
   Programs compiling with `-fopenmp` must use CUDA 12.1.1 or later to avoid this bug, or manually change their header as described in the issue.

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
        * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
          the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
        * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
          OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
        * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
          OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Cray LibSci_ACC 24.03.1
=======================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    March 2024

  Purpose:
  --------
    The Cray LibSci_ACC 24.03.1 release provides accelerated versions of
    scientific libraries for HPE Cray systems with accelerators.

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 24.03.1 requires the following platform:

      HPE Cray EX system with AMD MI250X
      HPE Cray EX system with AMD MI300A
      HPE Cray EX system with Nvidia Hopper

    Cray LibSci_ACC 24.03.1 supports the following OS:

      RHEL 8.8 x86_64
      SLES 15 SP4 x86_64
      SLES 15 SP5 x86_64 & aarch64

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    LAPACK workspace calculations from other implementations or hard-coded
    values may not be compatible with libsci_acc.  Workspaces reported from
    a query to the corresponding libsci_acc function should be used.

    The current supported usecase is a one-rank to one-gpu mapping for apps.

    Performance improvements can be achieved in programs calling libsci_acc
    subroutines by using pinned memory. See the intro_libsci_acc man page for
    details.

    Use of the aprun option "-cc none" or the srun option "--cpu_bind=none"
    to disable core affinity is strongly suggested to maintain performance.

    When using non-default cray-libsci_acc versions users should set equivalent
    at runtime and linktime after loading the desired cray-libsci_acc module:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci_acc man page for additional information.

  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci_acc

  Sample Installation instructions:
  ---------------------------------
    RPM install command:

      rpm -ivh cray-libsci-acc-24.03.1-*.##ARCH##.rpm

    The "*" in the install command represents compiler version combinations.

Cray MPICH 8.1.29:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  February 21, 2024


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.29 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.29 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:
      - Starting from the 8.1.26 release, Cray MPICH supports the Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU HBM 
        processor architecture.

      - On systems with AMD GPUs, Cray MPICH 8.1.26 supports all ROCm
        versions starting from ROCm 5.0, including the latest ROCm 5.5.0 
        release. 
 
        The Cray MPICH 8.1.25 release and prior versions of 
        Cray MPICH are only compatible with ROCm versions up to (and 
        including) the ROCm 5.4.0 release.

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

  Limitations in Cray MPICH 8.1.29:

      - Cray MPICH 8.1.29 can support only ~2040 simultaneous MPI
        communicators.  This limit is less the XC Cray MPICH limit of
        ~4090 simultaneous communicators.  Cray intends to raise the
        limit in a future release of Cray MPICH for Shasta to at least
        the XC limit.
