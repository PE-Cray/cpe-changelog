Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.5:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  August 2021


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Purpose:
---------
  This release includes the following new features and bugfixes:
    - Full support for CPU and GPU kernel debugging on AMD GPUs
      using the ROCm runtime.
    - Support analysis of binaries built with PGI and Intel compilers.
      Note: there is a known issue with corefile generation for Intel-
      built binaries. If corefile support is desired, set
      ATP_GDB_BINARY to the path to your system's GDB binary.

        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.18/doc/python_example.txt
 
Example:
      As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.  
      After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
      this release by executing the following commands:                   
 
               # module load craypkg-gen
               # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210
 
        This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the 
        command:
               # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210

    Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
    Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs. 

    The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
        1) Build the open source software
        2) Create .pc files for libraries
        3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
        4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
        5) Package rpms
        6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Cray MPICH 8.1.9:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  August 18, 2021


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.9 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.9 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

    Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
    decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
    changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
    provided.

    NetCDF is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator.

Perftools 21.09.0
===============
 Release Date: September 02, 2021

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for Cray XC, Cray CS, HPE Apollo 80, 
   HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10 Plus (x86), and HPE Cray EX supercomputer (Shasta) 
   systems. This version of perftools supports CLE 7 on Cray XC systems, 
   RHEL/CentOS 8 on Cray CS and HPE Apollo systems, and V1.3 and V1.4 on Shasta.

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS WILL FAIL (see details below).

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o PAPI 6.0.0.9 (upstream bugfixes, Intel Icelake support (but no PAPI presets), 
    cray_pm support of COS v1.5, cray_rapl and cray_zenl3 components for AMD 
    processors with MSR Safe kernel module, cray_cassini component for Cassini NIC)
  o DWARF 21.2.0 (upstream bugfixes, extended support for DWARF5) 
  o Update trace group wrappers to support BLAS v3.10.0
  o Update trace group wrappers to support LAPACK v3.10.0
  o CrayPat runtime support for Intel Icelake (basic counter groups and derived metrics)
  o CrayPat runtime support for AMD RAPL counters and any x86 platform that configures 
    MSR Safe kernel module correctly
  o CrayPat runtime support for AMD Level 3 cache counters (no counter groups and no 
    derived metrics) and any x86 platform that configures MSR Safe kernel module correctly
  o PAPI and CrayPat support for ROCm 4.3.0
  o aocc/3.0.0 support
  o OpenMP target offload support for AMD GPUs
  o cce/12.0.1 fix for OpenMP target codes (cce/12.0.0 breaks perftools tracing 
    with C/C++ OpenMP target offload codes)
  o Shasta v1.5 support
  o Inline functions are now marked with 'I' within pat_report text reports
  o Improve time to generate perftools-lite-loops text report 

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this. 
    Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 
    release.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using 
    perftools with OpenMP codes.  Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used 
    in this situation.
  o Some codes may not show user functions in pat_report when using the intel or 
    gcc compilers. This is caused by problems with the dwarf being generated. In 
    this case, users should add '-finstrument-functions' to their compiler flags, 
    and rebuild. This will be addressed in a future release of perftools.
  o On machines with AMD GPUs, some applications may fail to link due to 
    'cannot find -lcupti', even when cuda is not installed, and there are no Nvidia 
    GPUs on the machine. There is no workaround. This will be addressed in a future 
    release of perftools.
  o Some applications built with gcc/11.2.0 may fail to produce usable experiment 
    directories on SLES-based machines.  The workaround is to use gcc/10.3.0.  
    This will be addressed in a future release of perftools.

 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o Correct default counter group for Intel Skylake processors.
  o Fixed pre-req so Perftools-lite-loops module can load properly.
  o Fix pat_report crash when processing a large call tree.
  o Fix segfault with lite-gpu and full trace when using NVIDIA GPUs

 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.
