Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.10:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  March 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  March 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Cray MPICH 8.1.15:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  March 23, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.15 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.15 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

MRNET 5.0.1:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  March 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  MRNet is a customizable, high-performance software infrastructure for
  building scalable tools and applications.  It supports efficient 
  multicast and data aggregation functionality using a tree of processes 
  between the tool's front-end and back-ends.  MRNet-based tools may use 
  these internal processes to distribute many important tool activities, 
  for example to reduce data analysis time and keep tool front-end loads 
  manageable.

  MRNet-based tool components communicate across logical channels called
  streams. At MRNet internal processes, filters are bound to these streams to
  synchronize and aggregate dataflows. Using filters, MRNet can efficiently
  compute averages, sums, and other more complex aggregations and analyses
  on tool data. MRNet also supports facilities that allow tool developers
  dynamically load new tool-specific filters into the system.  

Purpose:
---------

  22.04 Provide initial release for stand-alone mrnet.

Product and OS Dependencies:
-----------------------------
  The MRNET 5.0.1 is supported on the following Cray systems:

Perftools 22.04.0
===============
 Release Date: April 7, 2022

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for the following systems:
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with HPCM
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with CSM
   - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen 10 Plus Systems (x86)
   - HPE Apollo 80 Systems (ARM)
   - HPE Cray XC systems with CLE 7UP03
   - HPE Cray CS Systems with RH 8

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL. 
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this; 
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are 
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o Support for AMD ROCm 4.5.2 and 5.0 
  o Provide new API region functions, PAT_region_push(label) and PAT_region_pop(label)
     that are enabled by an associated environment variable setting,
     PAT_RT_CALLSTACK_MODE=trace, to facilitate integration with third party libraries
     such as Caliper.
  o Added support for AMD MI200 GPU HWPC collection
  o Reveal support for OpenMP 5.1 target offloading
  o Changed Accelerator Table from using Host Time to Time
  o DWARF 0.3.3 (upstream bugfixes, better LLVM support)
  o PAPI 6.0.0.14
      - Upstream bugfixes
      - Better Cassini support (Cassini Host SW v1.7.0 required)
      - Configure upstream cuda and nvml
      - New (upstream) cuda component (via PAPI only) currently only supported for
         devices with compute capability (CC) >= 7.5
         In the future, this will replace the cray_cuda component.
      - New (upstream) nvml component (via PAPI only)
  o Update trace group wrappers to support HDF5 v1.13.0
  o Update trace group wrappers to support CUDA v11.3.0
  o Update trace group wrappers to support HIP and HSA ROCm v5.0.0
  o Support for Nvidia-sdk/21.7 and 21.9 on XC.
  o Support for intel/2202.1.1 (important logj security fixes)
  o Support for cce/14.0.0

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o With the change to the accelerator table from using Host Time to Time, this changes
    the functions you might see. The older version with host time, functions with
    significant "host time" would attribute time to the calling function of the kernel.
    With the new change to Time, they do not take a significant amount of real CPU time.
    For AMD GPU kernels, you will now see kernels with hipKernel.kernelname listed in
    this table, rather than the calling function. For Nvidia GPU kernels, for now you will
    simply see cudaLaunchKernel -- we will be adding kernel name support in the next release.
    If you look at the calltree view, you can see the source of the cudaLaunchKernel's.
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.0 
    and later. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued by 
    CCE Fortran 12.0 and later. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts 
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including 
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t', 
    and 'pat_build -T'. 
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible 
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or 
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not 
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, 13.0.0, 
    and 13.0.1. A fix will be provided in a future release of CCE.
    The workaround is to add -hfunc_trace to all fortran compilations.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using

Cray PMI 6.1.1
==============================================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  March 21, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  The Cray Process Manager Interface Library provides the interface between the
  application launcher and other communication libraries such as MPICH and SHMEM.

  Cray PMI 6.1.1 is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.

  New Cray PMI features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------
  Starting with Cray-PMI 6.1.0 the cray-pmi and cray-pmi-lib modules have been
  combined into a single cray-pmi module.  The cray-pmi-lib module will no longer
  be installed by new cray-pmi rpms.  When the cray-pmi module is loaded, the
  pmi libraries will be linked with as-needed flags.  To assist with the
  transition, an earlier version of Cray-PMI will be provided non-default for
  several releases.  This will provide time for any script referencing the
  cray-pmi-lib module to be modified without immediately breaking.
 

  Bug fixes new to Cray PMI 6.1.1 include:

      - PE-39735 - Fix key-checking hang when PMI_DEBUG is set
      - PE-39934 - Fix double munmap of applist area
