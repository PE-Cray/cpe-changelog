Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.3:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2021


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Purpose:
---------
  This release includes the following new features and bugfixes:
    - Provisional support for CPU and GPU kernel debugging on AMD
      GPUs using the ROCm runtime. Some versions of the ROCm
      runtime may cause a known scheduler issue during ATP crash
      analysis. If encountered, disable ROCm GPU debugging by
      setting ATP_GDB_BINARY to an empty string. Automatic detection of
      the GDB version to use can be manually overridden by setting
      ATP_GDB_BINARY to the path to the desired GDB binary.
    - Reenable launch support for HPCM systems running PALS.

Product and OS Dependencies:

CCDB 4.12.2:
==================

Release Date:
--------------
July 2021

Product Description:
--------------------
CCDB, Cray's next generation debugging tool extends the comparative
debugging capabilities of gdb4hpc with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
enabling programmers to compare corresponding data structures
between two executing applications. Comparative debugging assists users with
locating sections of code containing data deviations introduced by algorithm
changes, compiler differences, and porting to new architectures/libraries.

Some features of ccdb include:

  * Side-by-side debugging session execution of two parallel applications

  * Automatic creation of comparison statements for all local variables in
    scope

  * Type templates for structured data types to selectively compare members

  * Warning/error epsilon tolerance values for floating point comparison

-----------
    o  Library dependencies for static libraries are not added to the .pc files
       for keywords Requires.private and Libs.private. A warning is issued by 
       the craypkg-gen tool to advise users to add this information to the 
       libraries .pc files.
    o  RPM limits packages to 4GB
 
Documentation:
--------------
    Man pages for craypkg-gen are found by executing ‘module load craypkg-gen’ 
    and then ‘man craypkg-gen’ See 
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config 
    introduction.
 
    Examples for creating modulefiles for Intel, PGI and Python are included in
    the craypkg-gen ‘doc’ directory:
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.17/doc/intel_example.txt
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.17/doc/pgi_example.txt
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.17/doc/python_example.txt
 
Example:
      As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.  
      After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
      this release by executing the following commands:                   
 
               # module load craypkg-gen
               # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210
 
        This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the 
        command:
               # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210
 
Installation instructions:
--------------------------

 rpm -ivh craypkg-gen-1.3.17-*-0.sles15sp2.202107210326.b8345e663fb01.x86_64.rpm

 To change the product version to default after installation:
 /opt/cray/pe/admin-pe/set_default_files/set_default_craypkg-gen_1.3.17

Product description:
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.17 utility provides the system administrator
    a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack. 
    Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
    Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs. 

    The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
        1) Build the open source software
        2) Create .pc files for libraries
        3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
        4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
        5) Package rpms
        6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Cray MPICH 8.1.8:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  July 21, 2021


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.8 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.8 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------
  Changes in Cray MPICH 8.1.8

      - CAST-25816 - Expand set default template to include more modules
      - PE-36385 - Sync compiler string for PrgEnv-AMD with the rocm-compiler lmod module
      - PE-36394 - Speed up inter-node transfers using dynamic window creation
      - PE-36492 - Improve GPU performance with GDRcopy
      - PE-36772 - Remove PATH entry to Cray-MPICH lmod module
