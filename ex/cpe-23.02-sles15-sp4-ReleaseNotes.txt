HPE Cray Programming Environment 23.02 Release Notes
====================================================

HPE Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) 15.0.1
===========================================

Release Date:
-------------
February 2023


Purpose:
--------
CCE 15.0.1 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for Cray XC and CS systems,
HPE Cray supercomputer systems, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems, and HPE Apollo 80 systems.


Key Changes and Support with CCE 15.0.1:
-------------------------------------------
CCE 15.0.1

 - Bug Fixes
 - Fixed incorrect libraries linked with --gcc-toolchain option
 - Add new feature as extension to the Fortran standard: Allow Arithmetic operator followed by
   Unary operator. Also add Ansi message for -en.
 - Add Fortran support for split DWARF and compressed DWARF:
     - Split DWARF: -gsplit-dwarf={split, single} Set this command-line option to 'split' to
       cause most DWARF information to be split into a separate .dwo file.  The default is
       single, which embeds DWARF information into the program binary as usual.
     - Compressed DWARF: -gz={none, zlib, zlib-gnu} Set this command-line option to 'zlib' or
       'zlib-gnu' to compress debug sections using the specified compression type.  'none' is
       the default.

------------
CCE-15.0.0

 - LLVM 15 base
 - SVE Support (beta)
 - Support for Intel Sapphire Rapids with High Bandwidth Memory
 - Support for AMD Genoa
 - Support for NVIDIA Grace (beta)
 - Additions to existing DWARF Support includes
     - AMD's heterogeneous DWARF in C/C++ is enabled by default. It can be disabled with the
       '-gno-heterogeneous-dwarf' command-line option.
     - Breakpoint and line number support in Fortran for GPU modules
     - much-improved support for aggregate types in CPU modules
 - The Fortran option -htcmalloc is deprecated and planned to be removed in CCE-16.0.0
 - Complete support for AddressSanitizer & ThreadSanitizer for Fortran programs (CPU only).
     Enabled using the command line option
       -fsanitize=address|thread
     The following options are recommended to be used when enabling sanitizers:
       -g to ensure optimizations do not elide genuine code bugs
       -hsystem_alloc to force use of system allocator, as opposed to tcmalloc as it is known to
        produce spurious LSAN diagnostics (note that tcmalloc is deprecated and planned to be
        removed in a future release).
     Note: AddressSanitizer does not support Fortran COMMON variables.
 - The following Fortran OpenACC 2.x/3.x features have been added in this release
     - "finalize" clause on "exit data"
     - "no_create" clause on structured data and compute constructs
     - "if" clause on "host_data"
- The following OpenMP 5.x features have been added in this release
     - "in_reduction" clause on "target" construct
     - "error" directive (Fortran)
     - "compare" clause on atomic construct (C/C++)
     - "assume" and "assumes" directives (Fortran)
     - "nothing" directive (Fortran)
     - "otherwise" clause for metadirective (Fortran)


User and Application Impact:
----------------------------
CCE-15.0.1

User binaries built with the --gcc-toolchain option will now link to libraries
in the specified GCC toolchain. Binaries built with the --gcc-toolchain option
in CCE 14 and prior versions of CCE 15 may need to be rebuilt. Users who do not
use the --gcc-toolchain option are unaffected.

Signed constant or variable (integer or real) following arithmetic operator does not have to be
put in parentheses. The result is similar to gfortran.

-----------
CCE-15.0.0

C++ applications built using CCE 13 or earlier may need to be recompiled due to the significant
changes that were necessary to implement C++17. This is expected to be a one-time requirement.

Some non-standard Cray Fortran extensions supporting shorthand notation for logical operations
will be removed in a future release. CCE 14 will issue warning messages when these are
encountered, providing time to adapt the application to use standard Fortran.

Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) 2.17.2:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Changelog:
---------
CTI 2.17.1 (PE 22.12) contains a new feature, file deduplication, for
Slurm and PALS workload managers. If enabled, CTI will run a check on
compute nodes to determine if files can be excluded from the shipped
package. This can significantly improve application startup time.
To enable, set the environment variable CTI_DEDUPLICATE_FILES=1.

NOTE:
Race condition workaround for PALS 1.2.3 in CTI 2.17.0 (22.11)

In PALS 1.2.3, there is a race condition between the tool launcher releasing a
job from the startup barrier and the job actually getting to the startup
barrier. This can result in the job receiving the startup barrier release
signal before it actually arrives there, resulting in the job getting stuck
in the barrier. As a workaround, the environment variable CTI_PALS_BARRIER_RELEASE_DELAY
can be set to add a delay between job startup and barrier release. If set to a
positve integer n, CTI will wait n seconds between starting a job and releasing
it from the barrier on PALS. A delay as small as one second works in most cases.

gdb4hpc 4.14.7:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1
=====================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    February 2023


  Purpose:
  --------
    Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 provides scientific libraries for Cray
    HPC systems. Cray LibSci is supported on the host CPU but
    not on the accelerator of these systems.

    The Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 release provides the following:

    * Compiler and dependency updates

    Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 includes the following versions of publicly
    available libraries:
      * LAPACK 3.10.1 - For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/lapack
      * ScaLAPACK 2.2.0 - (Scalable LAPACK) For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/scalapack.
      * QDWH 2.0.0 KSVD 1.0.0 - Polar decomposition and SVD packages, see
          https://github.com/ecrc/qdwh
          https://github.com/ecrc/ksvd
     

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------

    The Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 release requires the following:
        SLE 15 or RHEL 8   
        craype/2.7.3 or later

        AMD ROCm 5.x
        Intel 2022.x
        Nvidia 21.x, 22.x

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Cray MPICH 8.1.24:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  January 19, 2023


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.24 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.24 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------

      export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"

  This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.
  See:
      https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/212
      https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html

  Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
  decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
  changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
  provided.

Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
  For certain F77 source files, when compiling with gcc/10 & gcc/11 & gcc/12, it may be necessary
  to configure/compile with:
      export FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
      export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"

  This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.

Perftools 23.02.0
===============
 Release Date: February 02, 2023

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for the following systems:
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with HPCM
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with CSM
   - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen 10 Plus Systems (x86)
   - HPE Apollo 80 Systems (ARM)
   - HPE Cray XC Supercomputer Systems
   - HPE Cray CS Supercomputer Systems

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o Support for CUDA 11.8.0
  o Upgrade to DWARF 0.5.0
  o Upgrade to PAPI 7.0.0.1
  o Removed support for statically-linked executables via pat_build
  o Set PAT_RT_LIBPAPI_DSO in the runtime environment to specify an alternative
    PAPI dynamic shared object file; PAPI_BUILD_PAPI_LIBDIR is no longer supported

 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o Missing report information when using pat_run on executables without an
    _etext symbol
  o pat_run did not properly trace main functions

 Notes:
 ======

 Known Issues:
 =============
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.x
    and CCE Fortran 13.x. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued
    by those compilers. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t',
    and 'pat_build -T'.
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, and 13.x, but is
    fixed in CCE Fortran 14.0.0. For 12.x and 13.x, the workaround is to add -hfunc_trace
    to all fortran compilations and add -w to the pat_build invocation to enable tracing.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used
    in this situation.
  o Collecting CPU performance counter events on systems with Fujitsu A64fx processors is
    not available. Requesting such counter events will result in a WARNING but the
    instrumented program will execute, not collecting any counter events specified.
    This issue is fixed in the next perftools release.
  o Scalable vector extension (SVE) code may cause segmentation faults when
    PAT_RT_CALLSTACK_MODE is set to 'unwind'

 Dependencies:
 =============
 o A PDF reader (such as evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
   app2 online help.
 o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
   Perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
   release announcements.

======================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Valgrind4hpc is a Valgrind-based debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
  and errors in parallel applications. Valgrind4hpc aggregates any duplicate
  messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
  program behavior. Valgrind4hpc manages starting and redirecting output from many
  copies of Valgrind, as well as deduplicating and filtering Valgrind messages.
  If your program can be debugged with Valgrind, it can be debugged with
  Valgrind4hpc.
