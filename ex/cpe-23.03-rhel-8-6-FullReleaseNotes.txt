Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.18:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  February 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load cray-stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

HPE Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) 15.0.1
===========================================

Release Date:
-------------
February 2023


Purpose:
--------
CCE 15.0.1 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for Cray XC and CS systems,
HPE Cray supercomputer systems, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems, and HPE Apollo 80 systems.


Key Changes and Support with CCE 15.0.1:
-------------------------------------------
CCE 15.0.1

 - Bug Fixes
 - Fixed incorrect libraries linked with --gcc-toolchain option
 - Add new feature as extension to the Fortran standard: Allow Arithmetic operator followed by
   Unary operator. Also add Ansi message for -en.
 - Add Fortran support for split DWARF and compressed DWARF:
     - Split DWARF: -gsplit-dwarf={split, single} Set this command-line option to 'split' to
       cause most DWARF information to be split into a separate .dwo file.  The default is
       single, which embeds DWARF information into the program binary as usual.
     - Compressed DWARF: -gz={none, zlib, zlib-gnu} Set this command-line option to 'zlib' or
       'zlib-gnu' to compress debug sections using the specified compression type.  'none' is
       the default.

------------
CCE-15.0.0

 - LLVM 15 base
 - SVE Support (beta)
 - Support for Intel Sapphire Rapids with High Bandwidth Memory
 - Support for AMD Genoa
 - Support for NVIDIA Grace (beta)
 - Additions to existing DWARF Support includes
     - AMD's heterogeneous DWARF in C/C++ is enabled by default. It can be disabled with the
       '-gno-heterogeneous-dwarf' command-line option.
     - Breakpoint and line number support in Fortran for GPU modules
     - much-improved support for aggregate types in CPU modules
 - The Fortran option -htcmalloc is deprecated and planned to be removed in CCE-16.0.0
 - Complete support for AddressSanitizer & ThreadSanitizer for Fortran programs (CPU only).
     Enabled using the command line option
       -fsanitize=address|thread
     The following options are recommended to be used when enabling sanitizers:
       -g to ensure optimizations do not elide genuine code bugs
       -hsystem_alloc to force use of system allocator, as opposed to tcmalloc as it is known to
        produce spurious LSAN diagnostics (note that tcmalloc is deprecated and planned to be
        removed in a future release).
     Note: AddressSanitizer does not support Fortran COMMON variables.
 - The following Fortran OpenACC 2.x/3.x features have been added in this release
     - "finalize" clause on "exit data"
     - "no_create" clause on structured data and compute constructs
     - "if" clause on "host_data"
- The following OpenMP 5.x features have been added in this release
     - "in_reduction" clause on "target" construct
     - "error" directive (Fortran)
     - "compare" clause on atomic construct (C/C++)
     - "assume" and "assumes" directives (Fortran)
     - "nothing" directive (Fortran)
     - "otherwise" clause for metadirective (Fortran)


User and Application Impact:
----------------------------
CCE-15.0.1

User binaries built with the --gcc-toolchain option will now link to libraries
in the specified GCC toolchain. Binaries built with the --gcc-toolchain option
in CCE 14 and prior versions of CCE 15 may need to be rebuilt. Users who do not
use the --gcc-toolchain option are unaffected.

Signed constant or variable (integer or real) following arithmetic operator does not have to be
put in parentheses. The result is similar to gfortran.

-----------
CCE-15.0.0

C++ applications built using CCE 13 or earlier may need to be recompiled due to the significant
changes that were necessary to implement C++17. This is expected to be a one-time requirement.

Some non-standard Cray Fortran extensions supporting shorthand notation for logical operations
will be removed in a future release. CCE 14 will issue warning messages when these are
encountered, providing time to adapt the application to use standard Fortran.

Craypkg-gen 1.3.28
==============

Release date
------------
   October 2022

Purpose
-------
   Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed in this release
--------------------------
   - Remove lmod dynamic dierachy setup from intel-mixed.lua
   - Fix compiler environment variables in nvhpc lua modulefiles

Dependencies
------------
   The craypkg-gen 1.3.28 release is supported on the following HPE
   Cray systems:
   - Cray XC/XE/XK systems with CLE version 5.2 or later.
   - Cray EX systems SLE 15.0 or later and RHEL 8.0 or later.

   Driver support for integrating Third Party C, C++, and Fortran libraries
   through .pc files using pkg-config is used in CrayPE 2.x and later.


Limitation
----------
   - Library dependencies for static libraries are not added to the .pc files
       for keywords Requires.private and Libs.private. A warning is issued by
       the craypkg-gen tool to advise users to add this information to the
       libraries .pc files.
   - RPM limits packages to 4GB

Documentation
-------------
   Man pages for craypkg-gen are found by executing `module load craypkg-gen`
   and then `man craypkg-gen`. See
   http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config
   introduction.

   Examples for creating modulefiles for Intel, PGI and Python are included in
   the craypkg-gen ‘doc’ directory:

    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.28/doc/intel_example.txt
    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.28/doc/pgi_example.txt
    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.28/doc/python_example.txt

Example:

   - As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.
     After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
     this release by executing the following commands:

         # module load craypkg-gen
         # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210

     This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the
     command:

         # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210

Installation instructions
-------------------------

    rpm -ivh craypkg-gen-1.3.28-*-1.el8.202211162055.debb889235937.x86_64.rpm

   To change the product version to default after installation:

    /opt/cray/pe/admin-pe/set_default_files/set_default_craypkg-gen_1.3.28

Product description
-------------------

   The craypkg-gen 1.3.28 utility provides the system administrator
   a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack.
   Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
   Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs.

   The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
   1) Build the open source software
   2) Create .pc files for libraries
   3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
   4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
   5) Package rpms
   6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) 2.17.2:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Changelog:
---------
CTI 2.17.1 (PE 22.12) contains a new feature, file deduplication, for
Slurm and PALS workload managers. If enabled, CTI will run a check on
compute nodes to determine if files can be excluded from the shipped
package. This can significantly improve application startup time.
To enable, set the environment variable CTI_DEDUPLICATE_FILES=1.

NOTE:
Race condition workaround for PALS 1.2.3 in CTI 2.17.0 (22.11)

In PALS 1.2.3, there is a race condition between the tool launcher releasing a
job from the startup barrier and the job actually getting to the startup
barrier. This can result in the job receiving the startup barrier release
signal before it actually arrives there, resulting in the job getting stuck
in the barrier. As a workaround, the environment variable CTI_PALS_BARRIER_RELEASE_DELAY
can be set to add a delay between job startup and barrier release. If set to a
positve integer n, CTI will wait n seconds between starting a job and releasing
it from the barrier on PALS. A delay as small as one second works in most cases.


=======================================================================
## [2.17.2] - 2023-01-09 (23.02)
=======================================================================
 
### Bug Fixes
 
* Fix broken pkg-config --libs path in relocated install 
* PE-45079 - Added dynamic update of copyrights to installed files 
* PE-44117: Remove unused session directories on backend  
* PE-44686: Detect library fork in destructors

gdb4hpc 4.14.7:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1
=====================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    February 2023


  Purpose:
  --------
    Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 provides scientific libraries for Cray
    HPC systems. Cray LibSci is supported on the host CPU but
    not on the accelerator of these systems.

    The Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 release provides the following:

    * Compiler and dependency updates

    Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 includes the following versions of publicly
    available libraries:
      * LAPACK 3.10.1 - For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/lapack
      * ScaLAPACK 2.2.0 - (Scalable LAPACK) For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/scalapack.
      * QDWH 2.0.0 KSVD 1.0.0 - Polar decomposition and SVD packages, see
          https://github.com/ecrc/qdwh
          https://github.com/ecrc/ksvd
     

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------

    The Cray LibSci 23.02.1.1 release requires the following:
        SLE 15 or RHEL 8   
        craype/2.7.3 or later
        cray-mpich/8.1.0 or later

      One or more of the following compiler major versions:
        CCE 15.x
        GCC 10.x, 11.x, 12.x
        AOCC 3.x
        AMD ROCm 5.x
        Intel 2022.x
        Nvidia 21.x, 22.x

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

LibSci_ACC 22.12.2.1
====================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    December 2022

  Purpose and Misc:
  -----------------
    The Cray LibSci_ACC 22.12.2.1 release provides accelerated versions of
    scientific libraries for Cray systems with AMD MI100 or MI200 targets.

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 22.12.2.1 requires the following platform:

      HPE Cray EX system with AMD MI100 or MI200 support

    Cray LibSci_ACC 22.12.2.1 also requires:

      CCE 14.0 or later
      AMD ROCm 5.0 or later
      Cray MPICH 8.1.15 or later

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 22.12.2.1 supports AMD MI100 and MI200 targets.

    LAPACK workspace calculations from other implementations or hard-coded
    values may not be compatible with libsci_acc.  Workspaces reported from
    a query to the corresponding libsci_acc function should be used.

    The current supported usecase is a one-rank to one-gpu mapping for apps.

    Performance improvements can be achieved in programs calling libsci_acc
    subroutines by using pinned memory. See the intro_libsci_acc man page for
    details.

    Use of the aprun option "-cc none" or the srun option "--cpu_bind=none"
    to disable core affinity is strongly suggested to maintain performance.

    When using non-default cray-libsci_acc versions users should set equivalent
    at runtime and linktime after loading the desired cray-libsci_acc module:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  Documentation:
  --------------------------------
    See the intro_libsci_acc man page for additional information.

  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci_acc

  Sample Installation instructions:
  ---------------------------------
    Rpm install command:

      rpm -ivh cray-libsci-acc-22.12.2.1-*.x86_64.rpm

    The "*" in the install command represents compiler version combinations.

Cray MPICH 8.1.25:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  February 26, 2023


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.25 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.25 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

MRNET 5.0.4
===============

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  MRNet is a customizable, high-performance software infrastructure for
  building scalable tools and applications.  It supports efficient 
  multicast and data aggregation functionality using a tree of processes 
  between the tool's front-end and back-ends.  MRNet-based tools may use 
  these internal processes to distribute many important tool activities, 
  for example to reduce data analysis time and keep tool front-end loads 
  manageable.

  MRNet-based tool components communicate across logical channels called
  streams. At MRNet internal processes, filters are bound to these streams to
  synchronize and aggregate dataflows. Using filters, MRNet can efficiently
  compute averages, sums, and other more complex aggregations and analyses
  on tool data. MRNet also supports facilities that allow tool developers
  dynamically load new tool-specific filters into the system.

  Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
  decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
  changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
  provided.

  NetCDF is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator.

Sanitizers4hpc 1.0.4:
=========================

Release Date:
--------------
  November 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
Sanitizers4hpc is a debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
and errors in parallel applications. Using LLVM's AddressSanitizer or
LeakSanitizer as a data source, Sanitizers4hpc aggregates any duplicate
messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
program behavior.

Changelog:
---------
NOTE:
Shared library exposure in previous versions of sanitizers4hpc.

Previous versions of sanitizers4hpc incorrectly exported internal sanitizers4hpc
libraries into /opt/cray/pe/lib64, causing other programs that had that path in
their runpath or LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load libraries they didn't expect.

This has been fixed in the 22.08 release of sanitizers4hpc. However, links will
be present in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing to older versions of sanitizers4hpc,
if an older version is installed because old installations will still modify /opt/cray/pe/lib64 when ldconfig is run.

To clean up libraries left by previous versions of sanitizers4hpc:
Option 1:
  1. Uninstall all previously installed versions of sanitizers4hpc, or remove
     the .cray_dynamic_file_list file from all previously installed versions
     of sanitizers4hpc, typically installed in /opt/cray/pe/sanitizers4hpc.
  2. Remove any links in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing into a sanitizers4hpc installation.
  3. run ldconfig
Option 2:
  1. Uninstall all previous versions of santizers4hpc.

  Note:
  To enable gathering stack traces on an Nvidia GPU, the environment variable 
  STAT_GDB must be set to either cuda-gdb, which will require cuda-gdb to be 
  available in PATH.   Or it can be set a specific debugger.  We suggest the 
  version of cuda-gdb packaged with gdb4hpc, as in:

  export STAT_GDB=/opt/cray/pe/gdb4hpc/$GDB4HPC_VERSION/libexec/cuda110-gdb-guard

  After which stat-cl would be called using the options: -w -G -i

Valgrind4hpc 2.12.11
======================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Valgrind4hpc is a Valgrind-based debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
  and errors in parallel applications. Valgrind4hpc aggregates any duplicate
  messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
  program behavior. Valgrind4hpc manages starting and redirecting output from many
  copies of Valgrind, as well as deduplicating and filtering Valgrind messages.
  If your program can be debugged with Valgrind, it can be debugged with
  Valgrind4hpc.
