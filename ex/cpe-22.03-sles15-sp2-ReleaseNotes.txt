====================================================

CCDB 4.12.9:
==================

Release Date:
--------------
February 2022

Product Description:
--------------------
CCDB, Cray's next generation debugging tool extends the comparative
debugging capabilities of gdb4hpc with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
enabling programmers to compare corresponding data structures
between two executing applications. Comparative debugging assists users with
locating sections of code containing data deviations introduced by algorithm
changes, compiler differences, and porting to new architectures/libraries.

Some features of ccdb include:

  * Side-by-side debugging session execution of two parallel applications

  * Automatic creation of comparison statements for all local variables in
    scope

  * Type templates for structured data types to selectively compare members

  * Warning/error epsilon tolerance values for floating point comparison

  * PBS PRO, MOAB/TORQUE, and SLURM workload manager support

Cray MPICH 8.1.14:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  February 14, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.14 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.14 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

  Cray PMI 6.1.0 is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.

  New Cray PMI features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------
  Starting with Cray-PMI 6.1.0 the cray-pmi and cray-pmi-lib modules have been
  combined into a single cray-pmi module.  The cray-pmi-lib module will no longer
  be installed by new cray-pmi rpms.  When the cray-pmi module is loaded, the
  pmi libraries will be linked with as-needed flags.  To assist with the
  transition, an earlier version of Cray-PMI will be provided non-default for
  several releases.  This will provide time for any script referencing the
  cray-pmi-lib module to be modified without immediately breaking.
 

  Bug fixes new to Cray PMI 6.1.0 include:

      - CAST-28257 - Link PMI libraries with as-needed flags
      - PE-38994 - Add a test of the PMI Instant On API
