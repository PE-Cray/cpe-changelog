Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.11:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Purpose:
---------
  22.05 This release adds the following content:
      - Update user trace API headers to support CCE 14

HPE Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) 14.0.0
==============================================

Release Date:
-------------
  May 2022

Purpose:
--------
  CCE 14.0.0 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for Cray XC and CS systems, 
  HPE Cray supercomputer systems, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems, and HPE Apollo 80 systems. 

Key Changes and Support with CCE 14.0.0:
----------------------------------------
Programming languages and models:
  - C++17
  - C17 with Clang
  - Fortran F2018
  - OpenMP 

Language technology:
  - Cray Fortran version 14.0
  - Clang version 14 for C and C++
  - LLVM version 14 base

New GPU support:
  - AMD ROCm 5.0/5.1

CPU Debugging tools for C and C++, with partial Fortran support:
  - (Beta) AddressSanitizer (-g -fsanitize=address)(Fortran common block support in a future release)
  - (Beta) ThreadSanitizer (-fsanitize=thread)
  - Archer OpenMP runtime error detection

Compiler improvements:
  - Faster compilation for some key Fortran applications
  - Improved diagnostics for all languages

OpenMP Features (Fortran only):
  - OpenMP "SIMD" support is now on by default for Fortran ("-f no-openmp-simd" to disable)[PE-27417]
  - task reductions
  - simd if
  - (GPU AMD MI250X) "requires unified_shared_memory"

OpenACC 2.6 and 3.0 Features (Fortran only):
  - "if" clause on "acc wait"
  - "if_present" clause on "update"
  - "acc_attach" and "acc_attach_async" application programming interfaces (APIs)
  - "async" and "wait" on "acc data"

Performance improvements:
  - General performance improvements for CPU and GPU
  - Improved AMD GPU performance from loop unrolling
  - Improved OpenMP "device scope" atomics and fence performance

    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config 
    introduction.
 
    Examples for creating modulefiles for Intel, PGI and Python are included in
    the craypkg-gen ‘doc’ directory:
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.24/doc/intel_example.txt
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.24/doc/pgi_example.txt
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.24/doc/python_example.txt
 
Example:
      As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.  
      After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
      this release by executing the following commands:                   
 
               # module load craypkg-gen
               # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210
 
        This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the 
        command:
               # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210
 
Installation instructions:
--------------------------

 rpm -ivh craypkg-gen-1.3.24-*-0.sles15sp2.202203161450.29d7b93724d6e.x86_64.rpm

Product description:
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.24 utility provides the system administrator
    a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack. 
    Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
    Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs. 

    The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
        1) Build the open source software
        2) Create .pc files for libraries
        3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
        4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
        5) Package rpms
        6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) 2.15.11:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Purpose:
---------
  22.05 This release adds the following content:
      - cti(1) user documentation and cti(3) C API documentation
      - Dyninst has been updated to v12.1.0

      This release fixes the following bugs:
      - PALS' cti_pals_getApid function would not complete properly
      - CTI Frontend daemon would sometimes encounter a double-free
        upon normal exit. Does not affect running applications or
        debugger tools.

  22.04 This release adds the following features:
      - Update Shasta PALS implementation to use PALS utilities and deprecate
        the previous Shasta PALS API
      - Update the HPCM PALS implementations to use PALS utilities

      This release fixes the following bugs:
      - Fix the usage of the `aprun` launcher with HPCM PALS instead of
        the default `mpiexec` launcher
      - Fix HPCM PALS backend startup when node hostnames are in xname format

  22.02 This release is a bugfix release:
      - Default Shasta PALS node count in job launches to 1
      - Include `--overlap` in Slurm tool daemon launches for Slurm versions
        20.11 and above

  21.12 This release adds the following features:
      - Added user documentation manpage cti(1), and developer
        documentation manpage cti(3).
      - Preliminary support for the Flux workload manager.
        Note that passwordless SSH access to compute nodes must be
        configured for Flux support. This limitation will be
        removed in a future release.
      - Flux, Shasta PALS, and ALPS support can be disabled at
        compile-time if development headers are not available.
      - Updated gen compilers to cray-gcc-10.3.0

  21.11 This bugfix release resolves the following issues:
      - Fix potential deadlock during job launch / attach for HPCM PALS systems,
        as well as the generic SSH interface
      - Fix Slurm job attach when running on compute node where hostname does
        not match the Slurm node name
      - Add environment variable CTI_SLURM_DAEMON_GRES to set the --gres
        for Slurm daemon launches. For Slurm versions 21.08 and newer, this
        should be set to an empty string (see SchedMD bug)
        https://bugs.schedmd.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12642

--------------
  April 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

           index/difference pairs instead of long changes of zeros
      - <optimized-out> and other gdb errors are handled correctly by
          print
      - Arrays are printed out in language specific format
      - Assertion scripts no longer need a decomposition if the number
          of compared ranks is equivalent
      - Improved error reporting for assertion scripts
      - Add --non-mpi launch option to enforce a start-up barrier without
          work load manager support

  ----------------------------

    The Cray LibSci 21.08.1.x release requires the following:
        SLE 15 or RHEL 8   
        craype/2.7.3
        cray-mpich/8.1.0

      One or more of the following compiler major versions:
        CCE 12.x
        GCC 9.x
        AOCC 2.x
        Intel 19.x
        Nvidia 20.x

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:

Cray MPICH 8.1.16:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  April 18, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.16 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.16 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------
  Changes in Cray MPICH 8.1.16

      - PE-29332 - Add Dynamic Process Management information to intro_mpi man page
      - PE-40421 - Fix reg-cache bug in gtl libraries
      - PE-40596 - Add lmod compatibility with CCE 14



Product and OS Dependencies:
----------------------------

MRNET 5.0.2:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  MRNet is a customizable, high-performance software infrastructure for
  building scalable tools and applications.  It supports efficient 
  multicast and data aggregation functionality using a tree of processes 
  between the tool's front-end and back-ends.  MRNet-based tools may use 
  these internal processes to distribute many important tool activities, 
  for example to reduce data analysis time and keep tool front-end loads 
  manageable.

  MRNet-based tool components communicate across logical channels called
  streams. At MRNet internal processes, filters are bound to these streams to
  synchronize and aggregate dataflows. Using filters, MRNet can efficiently
  compute averages, sums, and other more complex aggregations and analyses
  on tool data. MRNet also supports facilities that allow tool developers
  dynamically load new tool-specific filters into the system.  

Purpose:
---------
  22.05 This is a feature release.
        - Dyninst has been updated to v12.1.0.

  22.04 Provide initial release for stand-alone mrnet.

Perftools 22.05.0
===============
 Release Date: May 5, 2022 

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature release for the following systems:
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with HPCM
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with CSM
   - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen 10 Plus Systems (x86)
   - HPE Apollo 80 Systems (ARM)
   - HPE Cray XC systems with CLE 7UP03
   - HPE Cray CS Systems with RH 8

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system,
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL.
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this;
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
   o CCE 14 support.

 Known Issues:
 =============
  o With the change to the accelerator table from using Host Time to Time, this changes
    the functions you might see. The older version with host time, functions with
    significant "host time" would attribute time to the calling function of the kernel.
    With the new change to Time, they do not take a significant amount of real CPU time.
    For AMD GPU kernels, you will now see kernels with hipKernel.kernelname listed in
    this table, rather than the calling function. For Nvidia GPU kernels, for now you will
    simply see cudaLaunchKernel -- we will be adding kernel name support in the next release.
    If you look at the calltree view, you can see the source of the cudaLaunchKernel's.
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.0
    and later. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued by
    CCE Fortran 12.0 and later. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t',
    and 'pat_build -T'.
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, 13.x,
    and 14.x. A fix will be provided in a future release of CCE.
    The workaround is to add -hfunc_trace to all fortran compilations and add
    -w to the pat_build invocation to enable tracing.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used
    in this situation.

 Dependencies:
 =============
 o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
   app2 online help.
 o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
   Perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
   release announcements.

Cray PMI 6.1.2
==============================================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 18, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  The Cray Process Manager Interface Library provides the interface between the
  application launcher and other communication libraries such as MPICH and SHMEM.

  Cray PMI 6.1.2 is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.

  New Cray PMI features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------
  Starting with Cray-PMI 6.1.0 the cray-pmi and cray-pmi-lib modules have been
  combined into a single cray-pmi module.  The cray-pmi-lib module will no longer
  be installed by new cray-pmi rpms.  When the cray-pmi module is loaded, the
  pmi libraries will be linked with as-needed flags.  To assist with the
  transition, an earlier version of Cray-PMI will be provided non-default for
  several releases.  This will provide time for any script referencing the
  cray-pmi-lib module to be modified without immediately breaking.
 

  Bug fixes new to Cray PMI 6.1.2 include:

      - CAST-29630 - Fix for MPMD using Cray PALS
      - PE-34816   - Improvement in pmi_inet_setup and inet_ipaddr_from_dev

Product and OS Dependencies:
