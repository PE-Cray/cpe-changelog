Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.9:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Craypkg-gen 1.3.23
==============

Release Date:
-------------
    March  2022

Purpose:
--------
   - Add support to generate nvhpc modulefiles.
 
Dependencies:
-------------
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.23 release is supported on the following Cray
    systems running Cray Linux Environment (CLE) operating system:
    o   Cray XC/XE/XK systems with CLE version 5.2 or later.
 
    Driver support for integrating Third Party C, C++, and Fortran libraries
    through .pc files using pkg-config is used in CrayPE 2.x and later


Limitation:
-----------
    o  Library dependencies for static libraries are not added to the .pc files
       for keywords Requires.private and Libs.private. A warning is issued by 
       the craypkg-gen tool to advise users to add this information to the 
       libraries .pc files.
    o  RPM limits packages to 4GB
 
Documentation:
--------------
    Man pages for craypkg-gen are found by executing ‘module load craypkg-gen’ 
    and then ‘man craypkg-gen’ See 
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config 
    introduction.
 
    Examples for creating modulefiles for Intel, PGI and Python are included in
    the craypkg-gen ‘doc’ directory:
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.23/doc/intel_example.txt
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.23/doc/pgi_example.txt
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.23/doc/python_example.txt
 
Example:
      As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.  
      After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
      this release by executing the following commands:                   
 
               # module load craypkg-gen
               # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210
 
        This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the 
        command:
               # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210
 
Installation instructions:
--------------------------

 rpm -ivh craypkg-gen-1.3.23-*-0.el8.202202120317.6eba435df6273.x86_64.rpm

Product description:
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.23 utility provides the system administrator
    a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack. 
    Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
    Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs. 

    The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
        1) Build the open source software

Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) 2.15.9:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  February 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Purpose:
---------
  22.02 This release is a bugfix release:
      - Default Shasta PALS node count in job launches to 1
      - Include `--overlap` in Slurm tool daemon launches for Slurm versions
        20.11 and above

  21.12 This release adds the following features:
      - Added user documentation manpage cti(1), and developer
        documentation manpage cti(3).
      - Preliminary support for the Flux workload manager.
        Note that passwordless SSH access to compute nodes must be
        configured for Flux support. This limitation will be
        removed in a future release.
      - Flux, Shasta PALS, and ALPS support can be disabled at
        compile-time if development headers are not available.
      - Updated gen compilers to cray-gcc-10.3.0

  21.11 This bugfix release resolves the following issues:
      - Fix potential deadlock during job launch / attach for HPCM PALS systems,
        as well as the generic SSH interface
      - Fix Slurm job attach when running on compute node where hostname does
        not match the Slurm node name
      - Add environment variable CTI_SLURM_DAEMON_GRES to set the --gres
        for Slurm daemon launches. For Slurm versions 21.08 and newer, this
        should be set to an empty string (see SchedMD bug)
        https://bugs.schedmd.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12642

  21.10 This bugfix release resolves the following issues:
      - Added CRAY_CTI_PREFIX and CRAY_CTI_VERSION environment variables to the
        modulefiles.

    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci

Cray MPICH 8.1.14:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  February 14, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.14 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.14 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

Perftools 21.12.0
===============
 Release Date: December 16, 2021

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for HPE Apollo 80, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10 
   Plus (x86), and HPE Cray EX supercomputer (Shasta) systems. This version of 
   perftools supports CLE 7 on Cray XC systems, RHEL/CentOS 8 on Cray CS and HPE 
   Apollo systems, and V1.4 and V1.5 on Shasta.

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL. 
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this; 
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are 
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o PAPI 6.0.0.12 - upstream bugfixes, built with ROCM 4.5.0
  o LIBDWARF 0.2.1 - upstream bugfixes and features, more complete DWARF5 support 
  o ROCm/4.5 support
  o Support for intel/2021.4
  o Support for Nvidia-sdk/21.9 for Everest
  o Support for cce/13.0.0
  o Support for AMD MI200 and AMD Trento
  o Cray-libelf version dependency changed to 0.8.14
  o Consolidate inline function data to reduce the size of AP2 files.
  o Reduced AMD GPU Hardware Performance Counter collection overhead. When collecting 
    HWPCs for AMD GPUs, accelerator kernels are serialized by default. This behavior 
    is controlled via the AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL option, which may be set to 0 if
    kernel serialization is not desired. Please see the accpc manpage for more details.

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.0 
    and later. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued by 
    CCE Fortran 12.0 and later. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts 
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including 
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t', 
    and 'pat_build -T'. 
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible 
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or 
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not 
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, 13.0.0, 
    and 13.0.1. A fix will be provided in a future release of CCE.
    The workaround is to add -hfunc_trace to all fortran compilations.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using 
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used 
    in this situation.

 CAST Bugs Fixed:
 ================
  o CAST-27322 pat_build - two versions of libsci are linked in
     
 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o 'papi_native_avail' segfault fixed by Papi 6.0.0.12.
  o Correctly report PEs per node on EX systems.
  o Fix segfault during Perftools-lite report generation with GCC compiled codes.
  o Fix for some user functions not showing in pat_report with GCC or Intel 
    compiled codes.
  o Force serialization of HIP kernels when collecting counters, to prevent 
    excessive overhead.
  o Properly handle inlined functions that were previously rejected as having 
    invalid address ranges.

 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.

Cray-Stat 4.11.9
=============

Release Date:
-------------
  January 2022

Purpose:
--------
  22.02 This is a feature release.
      - Utilizes dyninst v12.0
      - Regarding gen compilers cray-gcc-10.3.0
        NOTE: If you encounter the following error:
        ImportError: /lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found 
        Temporary workaround:
        1) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/gcc/10.3.0/snos/lib64
        or
        2) module load gcc/10.3.0

  21.12 This is a feature release.

      - Updated gen compilers to cray-gcc-10.3.0
      - Fixed CAST-28357 stat-gui does not start if pygment module is installed
        on system
      - Fix reporting of cuda threads when running on multiple devices 

  21.11 This is a bug fix release.

      - Added support for gathering stack traces on an Nvidia GPU.

        To enable, the environment variable STAT_GDB must be set to either
        cuda-gdb, which will require cuda-gdb to be available in PATH.   Or
        it can be set a specific debugger.  We suggest the version of cuda-gdb
        packaged with gdb4hpc, as in:

        export STAT_GDB=/opt/cray/pe/gdb4hpc/$GDB4HPC_VERSION/libexec/cuda110-gdb-guard

        After which stat-cl would be called using the options: -w -G -i

  21.10 This is a bug fix release.

    - Added support for gathering stack traces on an Nvidia GPU.

      To enable, the environment variable STAT_GDB must be set to either
