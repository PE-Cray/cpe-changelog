Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.7:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  October 2021


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Purpose:
---------
  This bugfix release resolves the following issues:
    - Fixes a potential hang or assertion failure when
      analyzing a job using the Nvidia runtime with CUDA-GDB

Product description:
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.20 utility provides the system administrator
    a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack. 
    Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
    Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs. 

    The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
        1) Build the open source software
        2) Create .pc files for libraries
        3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
        4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
        5) Package rpms
        6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

============

Release Date:
-------------
  June 2020

Product Description:
--------------------
  IOBUF is an I/O buffering library that can reduce the I/O wait time
  for programs that read or write large files sequentially. IOBUF
  intercepts I/O system calls such as read and open and adds a layer of
  buffering, thus improving program performance by enabling asynchronous
  prefetching and caching of file data.

Purpose:
--------
  The following bugs are fixed in the iobuf 2.0.10 release.
    CAST-7645  can load multiple iobuf module versions
    CAST-19029 cray iobuf fwrite does not work
    CAST-20732 Out of memory caused by fflush+close instead of fclose

Known problems:
---------------
  The iobuf "direct" option causes Fortran sequential, unformatted I/O 
  to fail on CLE 5.0 and later systems.  For more information,
  please see PE-15003, "Fortran sequential writes fail with 
  IOBUF direct option on Lustre 2.x".

        Nvidia 20.x

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Cray MPICH 8.1.11:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  October 21, 2021


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.11 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.11 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

Perftools 21.10.0
===============
 Release Date: October 07, 2021

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for HPE Apollo 80, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10 
   Plus (x86), and HPE Cray EX supercomputer (Shasta) systems. This version of 
   perftools supports CLE 7 on Cray XC systems, RHEL/CentOS 8 on Cray CS and HPE 
   Apollo systems, and V1.3 and V1.4 on Shasta.

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS WILL FAIL (see details below).

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o Bugfix for AMD GPUs, some applications may fail to link due to
    'cannot find -lcupti', even when CUDA is not installed, and there are no NVIDIA
    GPUs on the machine. 
  o Fix ==LO_MEMORY== appearing sometimes when profiling HIP codes
  o PAPI 6.0.0.10 with SLES ROCm support.

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o Hardware counter collection may fail on nodes with AMD GPUs. 
  o Ranks per node may be incorrectly reported for compute nodes named similar to 
    'x1000c2s3b1n0'.  Use 'pat_report -s ranks_per_node=X', where X is your known 
    ranks per node, to work around this problem.
  o After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this. 
    Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 
    and later releases.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using 
    perftools with OpenMP codes.  Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used 
    in this situation.
  o Some codes may not show user functions in pat_report when using the intel or 
    gcc compilers. This is caused by problems with the dwarf being generated. In 
    this case, users should add '-finstrument-functions' to their compiler flags, 
    and rebuild. This will be addressed in a future release of perftools.
  o Some applications built with gcc/11.2.0 may fail to produce usable experiment 
    directories on SLES-based machines.  The workaround is to use gcc/10.3.0.  
    This will be addressed in a future release of perftools.

 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  
 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.
