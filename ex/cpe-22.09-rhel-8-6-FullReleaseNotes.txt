Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.13:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

September 2022

Purpose:
--------
CCE 14.0.3 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for Cray XC and CS systems, 
HPE Cray supercomputer systems, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems, and HPE Apollo 80 systems. 

Key Changes and Support with CCE 14.0.3:
-------------------------------------------
CCE 14.0.3:
- Bug Fixes
- SVE support (beta)

------------
CCE 14.0.2:
- Bug Fixes
- AMD ROCm 5.2 support
- Support for generating native GPU floating-point atomic add instructions for "omp atomic"
  constructs
- Support for the "-m[no-]unsafe-fp-atomics" compiler flag (C, C++, and Fortran) for
  controlling native floating-point atomic generation on AMD MI250X GPUs

------------
CCE 14.0.1:
- Bug Fixes

------------
CCE 14.0.0:
- LLVM 14 base
- C++17 support
  - Note: libstdc++ (and associated C++ library headers) updated from GCC 8.1.0
    to 10.3.0. Recommend C++ objects be recompiled to avoid ABI incompatibilities.
- SVE support (beta)
- AMD ROCm 5.0 and 5.1 support
- Tuned Fortran AMDGPU loop unrolling heuristic
- Optimized OpenMP "device scope" atomics/fences
- Complete support for AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer (incl. Archer) for
  C/C++ programs (CPU only), enabled using the command line option

    -fsanitize=address|thread

- Preliminary support for AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer (incl. Archer)
  for Fortran programs (CPU only), enabled using the command line option

    -fsanitize=address|thread

  Note that:
    - The option -g is required for AddressSanitizer
    - COMMON variables are not supported by AddressSanitizer currently

- Optimized OpenMP offload kernel launch performance
- CCE supports partial OpenMP 5.0. The following OpenMP 5.0 features
  have been added in this release for Fortran, C, and C++, unless noted otherwise.
  - task reductions (Fortran)
  - simd if (Fortran)
  - "requires unified_shared_memory" for AMD MI250X (Fortran)
- CCE supports partial OpenACC 2.6 and 3.0. The following OpenACC features
  have been added in this release for Fortran.
  - "if_present" clause on "update"
  - "acc_attach" and "acc_attach_async" APIs
  - "async" and "wait" on "acc data"
  - "if" clause on "acc wait"

User and Application Impact:
---------------------------
C++ applications built using CCE 13 or earlier may need to be recompiled due to the significant
changes that were necessary to implement C++17.  This is expected to be a one-time requirement.

Some non-standard Cray Fortran extensions supporting shorthand notation for logical operations
will be removed in a future release.  CCE 14 will issue warning messages when these are
encountered, providing time to adapt the application to use standard Fortran.

Craypkg-gen 1.3.26
==============

Release date
------------
   September 2022

Purpose
-------
   Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed in this release
--------------------------
   - Remove conflicts nvhpc module has against nvidia module
   - Add CUDA header files to CPATH in nvhpc modulefile

Dependencies
------------
   The craypkg-gen 1.3.26 release is supported on the following HPE
   Cray systems:
   - Cray XC/XE/XK systems with CLE version 5.2 or later.
   - Cray EX systems SLE 15.0 or later and RHEL 8.0 or later.

   Driver support for integrating Third Party C, C++, and Fortran libraries
   through .pc files using pkg-config is used in CrayPE 2.x and later.


Limitation
----------
   - Library dependencies for static libraries are not added to the .pc files
       for keywords Requires.private and Libs.private. A warning is issued by
       the craypkg-gen tool to advise users to add this information to the
       libraries .pc files.
   - RPM limits packages to 4GB

Documentation
-------------
   Man pages for craypkg-gen are found by executing `module load craypkg-gen`
   and then `man craypkg-gen`. See
   http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config
   introduction.

   Examples for creating modulefiles for Intel, PGI and Python are included in
   the craypkg-gen ‘doc’ directory:

    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.26/doc/intel_example.txt
    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.26/doc/pgi_example.txt
    /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.26/doc/python_example.txt

Example:

   - As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.
     After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
     this release by executing the following commands:

         # module load craypkg-gen
         # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210

     This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the
     command:

         # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210

Installation instructions
-------------------------

    rpm -ivh craypkg-gen-1.3.26-*-1.el8.202208162204.b05a71569eea9.x86_64.rpm

   To change the product version to default after installation:

    /opt/cray/pe/admin-pe/set_default_files/set_default_craypkg-gen_1.3.26

Product description
-------------------

   The craypkg-gen 1.3.26 utility provides the system administrator
   a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack.
   Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
   Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs.

   The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
   1) Build the open source software
   2) Create .pc files for libraries
   3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
   4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
   5) Package rpms
   6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

gdb4hpc 4.14.3:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  August 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

Cray LibSci 22.08.1.1
=====================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    August 2022


  Purpose:
  --------
    Cray LibSci 22.08.1.1 provides scientific libraries for Cray
    HPC systems. Cray LibSci is supported on the host CPU but
    not on the accelerator of these systems.

    The Cray LibSci 22.08.1.1 release provides the following:

    * Gencompiler updates for packaged libraries
    * Fix for CAST-30361 for several compilers

    Cray LibSci 22.08.1.1 includes the following versions of publicly
    available libraries:
      * LAPACK 3.10.1 - For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/lapack
      * ScaLAPACK 2.2.0 - (Scalable LAPACK) For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/scalapack.
      * QDWH 2.0.0 KSVD 1.0.0 - Polar decomposition and SVD packages, see
          https://github.com/ecrc/qdwh
          https://github.com/ecrc/ksvd
     

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------

    The Cray LibSci 22.08.1.1 release requires the following:
        SLE 15 or RHEL 8   
        craype/2.7.3
        cray-mpich/8.1.0

      One or more of the following compiler major versions:
        CCE 12.x
        GCC 9.x
        AOCC 3.x
        Intel 19.x
        Nvidia 20.x

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Cray MPICH 8.1.19:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  August 30, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.19 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.19 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

MRNET 5.0.4
===============

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  MRNet is a customizable, high-performance software infrastructure for
  building scalable tools and applications.  It supports efficient 
  multicast and data aggregation functionality using a tree of processes 
  between the tool's front-end and back-ends.  MRNet-based tools may use 
  these internal processes to distribute many important tool activities, 
  for example to reduce data analysis time and keep tool front-end loads 
  manageable.

  MRNet-based tool components communicate across logical channels called
  streams. At MRNet internal processes, filters are bound to these streams to
  synchronize and aggregate dataflows. Using filters, MRNet can efficiently
  compute averages, sums, and other more complex aggregations and analyses
  on tool data. MRNet also supports facilities that allow tool developers
  dynamically load new tool-specific filters into the system.

Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
  For certain F77 source files, when compiling with gcc/10 & gcc/11 & gcc/12, it may be necessary
  to configure/compile with:
      export FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
      export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"

  This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.
  See:
      https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/212
      https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html

  Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
  decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
  changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
  provided.

  NetCDF is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator.

  o Limited incompatibilites with CCE 14 
  o Lack of hardware counter collection for Fujitsu A64fx processors

 Important note:
 ===============
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this;
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are

    used by Perftools, impacted driver versions: 495.29.05 - 510.60.02.  Reports generated 
    from applications run on devices using impacted drivers will list the accelerator devices 
    as "Unknown". Additionally, usage of accelerator performance counter groups is not 
    supported for experiments run on devices using impacted drivers.
  o ROCm 5.2.0 introduced API changes that prevent backwards compatibility with previous
    Perftools versions.

 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.

Cray PMI 6.1.5
==============================================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  August 15, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  The Cray Process Manager Interface Library provides the interface between the
  application launcher and other communication libraries such as MPICH and SHMEM.

  Cray PMI 6.1.5 is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.

  New Cray PMI features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------
  Starting with Cray-PMI 6.1.0 the cray-pmi and cray-pmi-lib modules have been
  combined into a single cray-pmi module.  The cray-pmi-lib module will no longer
  be installed by new cray-pmi rpms.  When the cray-pmi module is loaded, the
  pmi libraries will be linked with as-needed flags.  To assist with the
  transition, an earlier version of Cray-PMI will be provided non-default for
  several releases.  This will provide time for any script referencing the
  cray-pmi-lib module to be modified without immediately breaking.
 

  Bug fixes new to Cray PMI 6.1.5 include:

      - CAST-30385 - Change PMI_IFACE to support not using any suffix
      - PE-41850 - Enable Spawn API to work on Slurm

Product and OS Dependencies:
----------------------------
  The Cray PMI 6.1.5 release is supported on the following systems:
  * HPE Cray EX systems with CLE
  * HPE Apollo systems as part of the Cray Programming Environment

Sanitizers4hpc 1.0.1:
=========================

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
Sanitizers4hpc is a debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
and errors in parallel applications. Using LLVM's AddressSanitizer or
LeakSanitizer as a data source, Sanitizers4hpc aggregates any duplicate
messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
program behavior.

Changelog:
---------
NOTE:
Shared library exposure in previous versions of sanitizers4hpc.

Previous versions of sanitizers4hpc incorrectly exported internal sanitizers4hpc
libraries into /opt/cray/pe/lib64, causing other programs that had that path in
their runpath or LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load libraries they didn't expect.

This has been fixed in the 22.08 release of sanitizers4hpc. However, links will
be present in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing to older versions of sanitizers4hpc,
if an older version is installed because old installations will still modify /opt/cray/pe/lib64 when ldconfig is run.

To clean up libraries left by previous versions of sanitizers4hpc:
Option 1:
  1. Uninstall all previously installed versions of sanitizers4hpc, or remove
     the .cray_dynamic_file_list file from all previously installed versions
     of sanitizers4hpc, typically installed in /opt/cray/pe/sanitizers4hpc.
  2. Remove any links in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing into a sanitizers4hpc installation.
  3. run ldconfig
Option 2:
  1. Uninstall all previous versions of santizers4hpc.

  export STAT_GDB=/opt/cray/pe/gdb4hpc/$GDB4HPC_VERSION/libexec/cuda110-gdb-guard

  After which stat-cl would be called using the options: -w -G -i

Valgrind4hpc 2.12.10
======================

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Valgrind4hpc is a Valgrind-based debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
  and errors in parallel applications. Valgrind4hpc aggregates any duplicate
  messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
  program behavior. Valgrind4hpc manages starting and redirecting output from many
  copies of Valgrind, as well as deduplicating and filtering Valgrind messages.
  If your program can be debugged with Valgrind, it can be debugged with
  Valgrind4hpc.
