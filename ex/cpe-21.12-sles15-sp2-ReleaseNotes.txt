====================================================

Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.8:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  December 2021


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

--------------
  December 2021


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

Cray MPICH 8.1.12:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  December  1, 2021


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.12 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.12 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

Perftools 21.12.0
===============
 Release Date: December 16, 2021

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for HPE Apollo 80, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10 
   Plus (x86), and HPE Cray EX supercomputer (Shasta) systems. This version of 
   perftools supports CLE 7 on Cray XC systems, RHEL/CentOS 8 on Cray CS and HPE 
   Apollo systems, and V1.4 and V1.5 on Shasta.

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL. 
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this; 
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are 
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o PAPI 6.0.0.12 - upstream bugfixes, built with ROCM 4.5.0
  o LIBDWARF 0.2.1 - upstream bugfixes and features, more complete DWARF5 support 
  o ROCm/4.5 support
  o Support for intel/2021.4
  o Support for Nvidia-sdk/21.9 for Everest
  o Support for cce/13.0.0
  o Support for AMD MI200 and AMD Trento
  o Cray-libelf version dependency changed to 0.8.14
  o Consolidate inline function data to reduce the size of AP2 files.
  o Reduced AMD GPU Hardware Performance Counter collection overhead. When collecting 
    HWPCs for AMD GPUs, accelerator kernels are serialized by default. This behavior 
    is controlled via the AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL option, which may be set to 0 if
    kernel serialization is not desired. Please see the accpc manpage for more details.

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.0 
    and later. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued by 
    CCE Fortran 12.0 and later. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts 
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including 
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t', 
    and 'pat_build -T'. 
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible 
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or 
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not 
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, 13.0.0, 
    and 13.0.1. A fix will be provided in a future release of CCE.
    The workaround is to add -hfunc_trace to all fortran compilations.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using 
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used 
    in this situation.

 CAST Bugs Fixed:
 ================
  o CAST-27322 pat_build - two versions of libsci are linked in
     
 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o 'papi_native_avail' segfault fixed by Papi 6.0.0.12.
  o Correctly report PEs per node on EX systems.
  o Fix segfault during Perftools-lite report generation with GCC compiled codes.
  o Fix for some user functions not showing in pat_report with GCC or Intel 
    compiled codes.
  o Force serialization of HIP kernels when collecting counters, to prevent 
    excessive overhead.
  o Properly handle inlined functions that were previously rejected as having 
    invalid address ranges.

 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.
