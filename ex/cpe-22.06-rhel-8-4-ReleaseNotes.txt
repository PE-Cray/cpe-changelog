HPE Cray Programming Environment 22.06 Release Notes
====================================================

HPE Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) 14.0.1
==============================================

Release Date:
-------------
  June 2022

Purpose:
--------
  CCE 14.0.1 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for Cray XC and CS systems, 
  HPE Cray supercomputer systems, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems, and HPE Apollo 80 systems. 

Key Changes and Support with CCE 14.0.1:
----------------------------------------
Bug fixes (listed below).

User and Application Impact:
----------------------------
  C++ applications built using CCE 13 or earlier may need to be recompiled due to the significant changes that were necessary to implement C++17.  This is expected to be a one-time requirement.
  Some non-standard Cray Fortran extensions supporting shorthand notation for logical operations will be removed in a future release.  CCE 14 will issue warning messages when these are encountered, providing time to adapt the application to use standard Fortran.

Example:
      As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.  
      After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
      this release by executing the following commands:                   
 
               # module load craypkg-gen
               # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210
 
        This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the 
        command:
               # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210
 
Installation instructions:
--------------------------

 rpm -ivh craypkg-gen-1.3.25-*-0.el8.202205201941.06f168a485616.x86_64.rpm

Product description:
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.25 utility provides the system administrator
    a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack. 
    Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
    Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs. 

    The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
        1) Build the open source software
        2) Create .pc files for libraries
        3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
        4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
        5) Package rpms
        6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

gdb4hpc 4.14.1:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  May 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

Cray LibSci 22.06.1.x
=====================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    June 2022


  Purpose:
  --------
    Cray LibSci 22.06.1.x provides scientific libraries for Cray
    HPC systems. Cray LibSci is supported on the host CPU but
    not on the accelerator of these systems.

    The Cray LibSci 22.06.1.x release provides the following:
    * Gencompiler updates for several packaged libraries
    * Fixes for CAST-29890 and CAST-29859 related to library usage
      with HT-disabled or SMT-disabled node configurations

    Cray LibSci 22.06.1.x includes the following versions of publicly
    available libraries:
      * LAPACK 3.10.1 - For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/lapack
      * ScaLAPACK 2.0.2 - (Scalable LAPACK) For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/scalapack.
      * QDWH 2.0.0 KSVD 1.0.0 - Polar decomposition and SVD packages, see
          https://github.com/ecrc/qdwh
          https://github.com/ecrc/ksvd
     

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------

    The Cray LibSci 22.06.1.x release requires the following:
        SLE 15 or RHEL 8   
        craype/2.7.3
        cray-mpich/8.1.0

      One or more of the following compiler major versions:
        CCE 12.x
        GCC 9.x
        AOCC 3.x
        Intel 19.x
        Nvidia 20.x

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Cray MPICH 8.1.17:
=======================================

Release Date:
-------------
  May 27, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  Cray MPICH 8.1.17 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
  and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
    
  Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.17 from the XC Cray MPICH include:

      - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
        support.

      - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran

      - Does not support C++ language bindings

  New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:

      - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
        This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
        Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.

      - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
        version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
        a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
        details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
        selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
        environment variables documented in the mpi man page.

        MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
        MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
        MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS

      - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
        Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
        the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
        reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
        assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
        between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.

      - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
        By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
        allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
        However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
        may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
        manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
        the mpi man page.

      - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
        with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
        and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
        more information including relevant environment variables reference
        the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.

      - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------

Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
  For certain F77 source files, when compiling with gcc/10 & gcc/11, it may be necessary
  to configure/compile with:
      export FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
      export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"

  This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.
  See:
      https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/212
      https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html

  Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
  decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
  changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor

Perftools 22.06.0
===============
 Release Date: June 9, 2022

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for the following systems:
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with HPCM
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with CSM
   - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen 10 Plus Systems (x86)
   - HPE Apollo 80 Systems (ARM)

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system,
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL.
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this;
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o Support for AMD ROCm 5.1
  o Support for NVIDIA A100 GPU tracing
  o Update trace group wrappers to support CUDA v11.3.0
  o CCE fortran trace wrappers fixed with cce/14.0.0 and later
  o DWARF 0.4.0 (upstream bugfixes, finalized API, updated documentation)
  o PAPI 6.0.0.15
      - Upstream bugfixes
      - Support for Intel Sapphire Rapids

 Notes:
 ======
  o As of ROCm version 4.5, SLES 15 support is limited to SP3.

 Known Issues:
 =============
  o With the change to the accelerator table from using Host Time to Time, this changes
    the functions you might see. The older version with host time, functions with
    significant "host time" would attribute time to the calling function of the kernel.
    With the new change to Time, they do not take a significant amount of real CPU time.
    For AMD GPU kernels, you will now see kernels with hipKernel.kernelname listed in
    this table, rather than the calling function. For Nvidia GPU kernels, for now you will
    simply see cudaLaunchKernel -- we will be adding kernel name support in the next release.
    If you look at the calltree view, you can see the source of the cudaLaunchKernel's.
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.x
    and CCE Fortran 13.x. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued
    by those compilers. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t',
    and 'pat_build -T'.
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, and 13.x, but is
    fixed in CCE Fortran 14.0.0. For 12.x and 13.x, the workaround is to add -hfunc_trace
    to all fortran compilations and add -w to the pat_build invocation to enable tracing.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used
    in this situation.
  o Collecting CPU performance counter events on systems with Fujitsu A64fx processors is
    not available. Requesting such counter events will result in a WARNING but the
    instrumented program will execute, not collecting any counter events specified.
    This issue is fixed in the next perftools release.

 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o Fix number of reported accelerators in HIP experiments
  o Fix linking error for libraries that include "needed" options
  o Fix application hang when CUDA libraries are present, but no CUDA driver is active
  o Fix to prevent sporadic segfaults during run-time and post-processing

 Dependencies:
 =============
 o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
   app2 online help.
 o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
   Perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment

Cray PMI 6.1.3
==============================================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  May 23, 2022


Purpose:
--------
  The Cray Process Manager Interface Library provides the interface between the
  application launcher and other communication libraries such as MPICH and SHMEM.

  Cray PMI 6.1.3 is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.

  New Cray PMI features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:


Key Changes and Bugs Closed:
----------------------------
  Starting with Cray-PMI 6.1.0 the cray-pmi and cray-pmi-lib modules have been
  combined into a single cray-pmi module.  The cray-pmi-lib module will no longer
  be installed by new cray-pmi rpms.  When the cray-pmi module is loaded, the
  pmi libraries will be linked with as-needed flags.  To assist with the
  transition, an earlier version of Cray-PMI will be provided non-default for
  several releases.  This will provide time for any script referencing the
  cray-pmi-lib module to be modified without immediately breaking.
 

  Bug fixes new to Cray PMI 6.1.3 include:

      - PE-40939 - Fix for error in PMI munge authentication

Product and OS Dependencies:
----------------------------
  The Cray PMI 6.1.3 release is supported on the following systems:
