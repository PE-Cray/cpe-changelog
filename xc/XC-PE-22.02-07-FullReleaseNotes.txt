Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.9:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

LibSci_ACC 20.10.1
==================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    October 2020

  Purpose and Misc:
  -----------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 provides accelerated versions of scientific
    libraries for Cray systems with GPU targets.

    This Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 release provides the following:

      Support for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.0

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------
    This Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 release requires the following:

      Cray XC systems with GPU support running CLE 7.0
      Cray CS systems with GPU support running latest PE supported OS

    This Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 release requires the following:

      CUDA Toolkit 11.0
      LibSci 17.11.1 or later
      CCE 10.0 or later
      GCC 8.1 or later
      PE supported MPI libraries

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 supports NVIDIA Tesla V100, P100, KXX targets.

    LAPACK workspace calculations from other implementations or hard-coded
    values may not be compatible with libsci_acc.  Workspaces reported from
    a query to the corresponding libsci_acc function should be used.

    The current supported usecase is a one-rank to one-gpu mapping for apps.

    Applications running PBLAS routines on the accelerator should set the
    environment variable MPICH_NO_GPU_DIRECT=1 to ensure correctness.

    Performance improvements can be achieved in programs calling libsci_acc
    subroutines by using pinned memory. See the intro_libsci_acc man page for
    details.

    Use of the aprun option "-cc none" or the srun option "--cpu_bind=none"
    to disable core affinity is strongly suggested to maintain performance.

    When using non-default cray-libsci_acc versions users should set equivalent
    at runtime and linktime after loading the desired cray-libsci_acc module:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    This version and previous versions of LibSci_ACC are not thread-safe.

  Documentation:
  --------------------------------
    See the intro_libsci_acc man page for additional information.

  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci_acc

  Sample Installation instructions:
  ---------------------------------
    On CS and XC CLE 7.0 platforms:

      rpm -ivh cray-libsci-acc-20.10.1-*.x86_64.rpm

    The "*" in the install command represents compiler version combinations.

LibSci 20.09.1
==============

  Release Date:
  -------------
    September 2020


  Purpose:
  --------
    Cray LibSci 20.09.1 provides scientific libraries for Cray systems. 
    Cray LibSci is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator
    of these systems.

    Cray LibSci 20.09.1 includes the following versions of publicly
    available libraries:
      * LAPACK 3.6.1 - For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/lapack
      * ScaLAPACK 2.0.2 - (Scalable LAPACK) For further information, see
          http://www.netlib.org/scalapack.
      * KSVD 2.0.0 and POLAR v3.0.0 components - For further info, see
          https://github.com/ecrc
     

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------
    The Cray LibSci 20.09.1 release is supported on the following Cray systems:
    * Cray XC with CLE 7.0 and above

    The Cray LibSci 20.09.1 release requires the following software products:

    For Cray XC series systems:
      craype 2.6.0 or later
      MPT 7.7.8 or later

      One or more of the following major compiler versions:
        CCE 10 
        GCC 8
        GCC 9
        Intel 19

    For Cray CS systems:
      CCE 10 
      craype for CS
      MVAPICH2 or Intel MPI for CS


  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci


  Installation instructions:
  --------------------------
    LibSci is now packaged into separate compiler specific RPMs to allow
    rpmbuild to correctly include compiler dependencies.

Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
    For certain F77 source files, when compiling with gcc/10 & gcc/11, it may be necessary
    to configure/compile with:
        export FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
        export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch" 

    This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.
    See: 
       https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/212  
       https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html   
    
    Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
    decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
    changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
    provided.

    NetCDF is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator.

===============================

Release Date:
-------------
  September 2020

Product Information:
--------------------
OpenSHMEM is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) library interface
specification, which is the culmination of a standardization effort among
many implementers and users of SHMEM programming model. SHMEM has a long
history as a parallel programming model on Cray systems. For the past two
decades SHMEM library implementation in Cray systems evolved through
different generations. Cray OpenSHMEMX is a new proprietary SHMEM
implementation from Cray Inc for current and future generation Cray systems.

Announcements, release informations, supported environments, and backward
compatibility informations about this product can be viewed in the following
location: https://pe-cray.github.io/cray-openshmemx/

Purpose:
--------
    The following features are available in Cray OpenSHMEMX version
    9.1.2 from Cray OpenSHMEMX 9.1.1:

    - Fixed context creation bug, where the context creation returns a non-zero
    integer when the resources are not available instead of aborting

    - Fixed LMOD issues in using cray-openshmemx along with other libraries

NOTES:
    Cray OpenSHMEMX is supported on both X86_64 and AARCH64 based Cray systems.

    On X86_64 systems, Cray OpenSHMEMX version 8.0.0 is not released as a
    replacement library for the existing Cray SHMEM library. Cray OpenSHMEMX is
    released as a separate product from Cray SHMEM with plans to supersede the
    existing Cray SHMEM library in near future. Early access to Cray OpenSHMEMX
    library is provided for users to start migrating their existing applications
    to the new library.

    On AARCH64 systems, Cray OpenSHMEMX is the only available and supported
    SHMEM implementation by Cray Inc.

Release Date:
-------------
  June 2020

Product Description:
--------------------
  IOBUF is an I/O buffering library that can reduce the I/O wait time
  for programs that read or write large files sequentially. IOBUF
  intercepts I/O system calls such as read and open and adds a layer of
  buffering, thus improving program performance by enabling asynchronous
  prefetching and caching of file data.

Purpose:

  The following bugs are fixed in the iobuf 2.0.10 release.
    CAST-7645  can load multiple iobuf module versions
    CAST-19029 cray iobuf fwrite does not work
    CAST-20732 Out of memory caused by fflush+close instead of fclose

Known problems:
---------------
  The iobuf "direct" option causes Fortran sequential, unformatted I/O 
  to fail on CLE 5.0 and later systems.  For more information,
  please see PE-15003, "Fortran sequential writes fail with 
  IOBUF direct option on Lustre 2.x".

Operating System Dependencies:

Perftools 21.12.0
===============
 Release Date: December 16, 2021

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for HPE Apollo 80, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10 
   Plus (x86), and HPE Cray EX supercomputer (Shasta) systems. This version of 
   perftools supports CLE 7 on Cray XC systems, RHEL/CentOS 8 on Cray CS and HPE 
   Apollo systems, and V1.4 and V1.5 on Shasta.

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL. 
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this; 
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are 
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o PAPI 6.0.0.12 - upstream bugfixes, built with ROCM 4.5.0
  o LIBDWARF 0.2.1 - upstream bugfixes and features, more complete DWARF5 support 
  o ROCm/4.5 support
  o Support for intel/2021.4
  o Support for Nvidia-sdk/21.9 for Everest
  o Support for cce/13.0.0
  o Support for AMD MI200 and AMD Trento
  o Cray-libelf version dependency changed to 0.8.14
  o Consolidate inline function data to reduce the size of AP2 files.
  o Reduced AMD GPU Hardware Performance Counter collection overhead. When collecting 
    HWPCs for AMD GPUs, accelerator kernels are serialized by default. This behavior 
    is controlled via the AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL option, which may be set to 0 if
    kernel serialization is not desired. Please see the accpc manpage for more details.

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.0 
    and later. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued by 
    CCE Fortran 12.0 and later. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts 
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including 
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t', 
    and 'pat_build -T'. 
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible 
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or 
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not 
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, 13.0.0, 
    and 13.0.1. A fix will be provided in a future release of CCE.
    The workaround is to add -hfunc_trace to all fortran compilations.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using 
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used 
    in this situation.

 CAST Bugs Fixed:
 ================
  o CAST-27322 pat_build - two versions of libsci are linked in
     
 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o 'papi_native_avail' segfault fixed by Papi 6.0.0.12.
  o Correctly report PEs per node on EX systems.
  o Fix segfault during Perftools-lite report generation with GCC compiled codes.
  o Fix for some user functions not showing in pat_report with GCC or Intel 
    compiled codes.
  o Force serialization of HIP kernels when collecting counters, to prevent 
    excessive overhead.
  o Properly handle inlined functions that were previously rejected as having 
    invalid address ranges.

 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.

Product Description:
--------------------
  Valgrind4hpc is a Valgrind-based debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
  and errors in parallel applications. Valgrind4hpc aggregates any duplicate
  messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
  program behavior. Valgrind4hpc manages starting and redirecting output from many
  copies of Valgrind, as well as deduplicating and filtering Valgrind messages.
  If your program can be debugged with Valgrind, it can be debugged with
  Valgrind4hpc.
