Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.11:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Purpose:
---------
  22.05 This release adds the following content:
      - Update user trace API headers to support CCE 14

HPE Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) 14.0.0
==============================================

Release Date:
-------------
  May 2022

Purpose:
--------
  CCE 14.0.0 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for Cray XC and CS systems, 
  HPE Cray supercomputer systems, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems, and HPE Apollo 80 systems. 

Key Changes and Support with CCE 14.0.0:
----------------------------------------
Programming languages and models:
  - C++17
  - C17 with Clang
  - Fortran F2018
  - OpenMP 

Language technology:
  - Cray Fortran version 14.0
  - Clang version 14 for C and C++
  - LLVM version 14 base

New GPU support:
  - AMD ROCm 5.0/5.1

CPU Debugging tools for C and C++, with partial Fortran support:
  - (Beta) AddressSanitizer (-g -fsanitize=address)(Fortran common block support in a future release)
  - (Beta) ThreadSanitizer (-fsanitize=thread)
  - Archer OpenMP runtime error detection

Compiler improvements:
  - Faster compilation for some key Fortran applications
  - Improved diagnostics for all languages

OpenMP Features (Fortran only):
  - OpenMP "SIMD" support is now on by default for Fortran ("-f no-openmp-simd" to disable)[PE-27417]
  - task reductions
  - simd if
  - (GPU AMD MI250X) "requires unified_shared_memory"

OpenACC 2.6 and 3.0 Features (Fortran only):
  - "if" clause on "acc wait"
  - "if_present" clause on "update"
  - "acc_attach" and "acc_attach_async" application programming interfaces (APIs)
  - "async" and "wait" on "acc data"

Performance improvements:

        documentation manpage cti(3).
      - Preliminary support for the Flux workload manager.
        Note that passwordless SSH access to compute nodes must be
        configured for Flux support. This limitation will be
        removed in a future release.
      - Flux, Shasta PALS, and ALPS support can be disabled at
        compile-time if development headers are not available.
      - Updated gen compilers to cray-gcc-10.3.0

        as well as the generic SSH interface
      - Fix Slurm job attach when running on compute node where hostname does
        not match the Slurm node name
      - Add environment variable CTI_SLURM_DAEMON_GRES to set the --gres
        for Slurm daemon launches. For Slurm versions 21.08 and newer, this
        should be set to an empty string (see SchedMD bug)
        https://bugs.schedmd.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12642

    The Cray LibSci 22.05.1 release is supported on the following Cray systems:
    * Cray XC with CLE 7.0 and above

    The Cray LibSci 22.05.1 release requires the following software products:

    For Cray XC series systems:
      craype 2.6.0 or later
      MPT 7.7.8 or later

      One or more of the following major compiler versions:
        CCE 14 
        GCC 8
        GCC 9
        Intel 19

    For Cray CS systems:
      CCE 14 
      craype for CS
      MVAPICH2 or Intel MPI for CS


  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------

Cray Message Passing Toolkit 22.05:
==================================

Release Date:
-------------
    May 2022

Purpose:
--------
    The following new features has been added to Cray MPT 7.7.20 since
    the Cray MPT 7.7.19 release:

        -. Support for CCE 14.0.  Note that CCE 14.0 declares itself
           to be incompatible with previous versions for C++ support,
           thus cray-mpich/7.7.20 is incompatible with previous versions
           of CCE.

        - New 3rd party software support
          - Intel OneAPI 2022.1.2
          - Allinea 22.0.0.1
          - Nvidia SDK 22.2
          - Support for CUDA 11.6

    Additional Cray MPICH changes:

        - Miscellaneous internal build changes

    Additional Cray SHMEM changes:

        - Miscellaneous internal build changes


    The following bugs have been fixed since the Cray MPT 7.7.17 releases:

    Cray MPICH
        - No new bug fixes

    Cray SHMEM
        - No new bug fixes


    PLEASE NOTE:
       Cray MPICH:
           - GNU compiler support does not include Fortran 2008 language
             bindings support for Cray MPICH.

           - The Allinea 21.0 compiler (first supported in this release
             MPT 7.7.18) is ABI incompatible with previous Allinea
             compilers.  If an older Alliena compiler is desired an older
             MPT must be used.


       Cray SHMEM:
           - Cray SHMEM is not supported for aarch64.  Please use Cray
             OpenSHMEMX instead.

gdb4hpc 4.14.0:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  April 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

Purpose:
---------

  22.05 Release updates the minor version as there are significant chages:
      - C++ container of containers are correctly supported
      - Added support for C++ std::array and std::shared_ptr
      - The "difference vector" for array comparisons is now printed as
           index/difference pairs instead of long changes of zeros
      - <optimized-out> and other gdb errors are handled correctly by
          print
      - Arrays are printed out in language specific format
      - Assertion scripts no longer need a decomposition if the number
          of compared ranks is equivalent
      - Improved error reporting for assertion scripts
      - Add --non-mpi launch option to enforce a start-up barrier without
          work load manager support
      - Fixed the handling of fully distributed decompositions
      - Fixed the handling of C and fortran strings
      - Fixed artificial array syntax (myarray[0]@4) requiring quotes
      - Dyninst has been updated to v12.1.0

  22.04 Release adds the following feature:
      - Fix the identification of nodes with AMD GPU's when launching or
           attaching with the --gpu option
      - Improved error detection and reporting for assertion scripts
      - Removed extraneous line number reporting when used within ccdb
      - Decompositions now work with C/C++ arrays.  The array length
          is inferred from the decomposition.

  22.02 Release adds the following features:
      - Regarding gen compilers cray-gcc-10.3.0
        NOTE: If you encounter the following error:
        ImportError: /lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found 
        Temporary workaround:
        1) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/gcc/10.3.0/snos/lib64
        or
        2) module load gcc/10.3.0

  21.12 This is bugfix release
      - Updated gen compilers to cray-gcc-10.3.0

Perftools 22.05.0
===============
 Release Date: May 5, 2022 

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature release for the following systems:
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with HPCM
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with CSM
   - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen 10 Plus Systems (x86)
   - HPE Apollo 80 Systems (ARM)
   - HPE Cray XC systems with CLE 7UP03
   - HPE Cray CS Systems with RH 8

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system,
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL.
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this;
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
   o CCE 14 support.

 Known Issues:
 =============
  o With the change to the accelerator table from using Host Time to Time, this changes
    the functions you might see. The older version with host time, functions with
    significant "host time" would attribute time to the calling function of the kernel.
    With the new change to Time, they do not take a significant amount of real CPU time.
    For AMD GPU kernels, you will now see kernels with hipKernel.kernelname listed in
    this table, rather than the calling function. For Nvidia GPU kernels, for now you will
    simply see cudaLaunchKernel -- we will be adding kernel name support in the next release.
    If you look at the calltree view, you can see the source of the cudaLaunchKernel's.
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.0
    and later. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued by
    CCE Fortran 12.0 and later. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t',
    and 'pat_build -T'.
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, 13.x,
    and 14.x. A fix will be provided in a future release of CCE.
    The workaround is to add -hfunc_trace to all fortran compilations and add
    -w to the pat_build invocation to enable tracing.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used
    in this situation.

 Dependencies:
 =============
 o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
   app2 online help.
 o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
   Perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
   release announcements.
