HPE Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) 15.0.1
===========================================

Release Date:
-------------
February 2023


Purpose:
--------
CCE 15.0.1 provides Fortran, C, and C++ compilers for Cray XC and CS systems,
HPE Cray supercomputer systems, HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10Plus systems, and HPE Apollo 80 systems.


Key Changes and Support with CCE 15.0.1:
-------------------------------------------
CCE 15.0.1

 - Bug Fixes
 - Fixed incorrect libraries linked with --gcc-toolchain option
 - Add new feature as extension to the Fortran standard: Allow Arithmetic operator followed by
   Unary operator. Also add Ansi message for -en.
 - Add Fortran support for split DWARF and compressed DWARF:
     - Split DWARF: -gsplit-dwarf={split, single} Set this command-line option to 'split' to
       cause most DWARF information to be split into a separate .dwo file.  The default is
       single, which embeds DWARF information into the program binary as usual.
     - Compressed DWARF: -gz={none, zlib, zlib-gnu} Set this command-line option to 'zlib' or
       'zlib-gnu' to compress debug sections using the specified compression type.  'none' is
       the default.

------------
CCE-15.0.0

 - LLVM 15 base
 - SVE Support (beta)
 - Support for Intel Sapphire Rapids with High Bandwidth Memory
 - Support for AMD Genoa
 - Support for NVIDIA Grace (beta)
 - Additions to existing DWARF Support includes
     - AMD's heterogeneous DWARF in C/C++ is enabled by default. It can be disabled with the
       '-gno-heterogeneous-dwarf' command-line option.
     - Breakpoint and line number support in Fortran for GPU modules
     - much-improved support for aggregate types in CPU modules
 - The Fortran option -htcmalloc is deprecated and planned to be removed in CCE-16.0.0
 - Complete support for AddressSanitizer & ThreadSanitizer for Fortran programs (CPU only).
     Enabled using the command line option
       -fsanitize=address|thread
     The following options are recommended to be used when enabling sanitizers:
       -g to ensure optimizations do not elide genuine code bugs
       -hsystem_alloc to force use of system allocator, as opposed to tcmalloc as it is known to
        produce spurious LSAN diagnostics (note that tcmalloc is deprecated and planned to be
        removed in a future release).
     Note: AddressSanitizer does not support Fortran COMMON variables.
 - The following Fortran OpenACC 2.x/3.x features have been added in this release
     - "finalize" clause on "exit data"
     - "no_create" clause on structured data and compute constructs
     - "if" clause on "host_data"
- The following OpenMP 5.x features have been added in this release
     - "in_reduction" clause on "target" construct
     - "error" directive (Fortran)
     - "compare" clause on atomic construct (C/C++)
     - "assume" and "assumes" directives (Fortran)
     - "nothing" directive (Fortran)
     - "otherwise" clause for metadirective (Fortran)


User and Application Impact:
----------------------------
CCE-15.0.1

User binaries built with the --gcc-toolchain option will now link to libraries
in the specified GCC toolchain. Binaries built with the --gcc-toolchain option
in CCE 14 and prior versions of CCE 15 may need to be rebuilt. Users who do not
use the --gcc-toolchain option are unaffected.

Signed constant or variable (integer or real) following arithmetic operator does not have to be
put in parentheses. The result is similar to gfortran.

-----------
CCE-15.0.0

C++ applications built using CCE 13 or earlier may need to be recompiled due to the significant
changes that were necessary to implement C++17. This is expected to be a one-time requirement.

Some non-standard Cray Fortran extensions supporting shorthand notation for logical operations
will be removed in a future release. CCE 14 will issue warning messages when these are
encountered, providing time to adapt the application to use standard Fortran.

Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) 2.17.2:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2023


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Changelog:
---------
CTI 2.17.1 (PE 22.12) contains a new feature, file deduplication, for
Slurm and PALS workload managers. If enabled, CTI will run a check on
compute nodes to determine if files can be excluded from the shipped
package. This can significantly improve application startup time.
To enable, set the environment variable CTI_DEDUPLICATE_FILES=1.

NOTE:
Race condition workaround for PALS 1.2.3 in CTI 2.17.0 (22.11)

In PALS 1.2.3, there is a race condition between the tool launcher releasing a
job from the startup barrier and the job actually getting to the startup
barrier. This can result in the job receiving the startup barrier release
signal before it actually arrives there, resulting in the job getting stuck
in the barrier. As a workaround, the environment variable CTI_PALS_BARRIER_RELEASE_DELAY
can be set to add a delay between job startup and barrier release. If set to a
positve integer n, CTI will wait n seconds between starting a job and releasing
it from the barrier on PALS. A delay as small as one second works in most cases.

Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
  For certain F77 source files, when compiling with gcc/10 & gcc/11 & gcc/12, it may be necessary
  to configure/compile with:
      export FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
      export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"

  This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.
  See:
      https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/212
      https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html

  Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
  decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
  changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
  provided.

  NetCDF is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator.

Perftools 23.02.0
===============
 Release Date: February 02, 2023

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for the following systems:
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with HPCM
   - HPE Cray EX and HPE Cray Supercomputer Systems with CSM
   - HPE Apollo 2000 Gen 10 Plus Systems (x86)
   - HPE Apollo 80 Systems (ARM)
   - HPE Cray XC Supercomputer Systems
   - HPE Cray CS Supercomputer Systems

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o Support for CUDA 11.8.0
  o Upgrade to DWARF 0.5.0
  o Upgrade to PAPI 7.0.0.1
  o Removed support for statically-linked executables via pat_build
  o Set PAT_RT_LIBPAPI_DSO in the runtime environment to specify an alternative
    PAPI dynamic shared object file; PAPI_BUILD_PAPI_LIBDIR is no longer supported

 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o Missing report information when using pat_run on executables without an
    _etext symbol
  o pat_run did not properly trace main functions

 Notes:
 ======

 Known Issues:
 =============
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.x
    and CCE Fortran 13.x. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued
    by those compilers. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t',
    and 'pat_build -T'.
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, and 13.x, but is
    fixed in CCE Fortran 14.0.0. For 12.x and 13.x, the workaround is to add -hfunc_trace
    to all fortran compilations and add -w to the pat_build invocation to enable tracing.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used
    in this situation.
  o Collecting CPU performance counter events on systems with Fujitsu A64fx processors is
    not available. Requesting such counter events will result in a WARNING but the
    instrumented program will execute, not collecting any counter events specified.
    This issue is fixed in the next perftools release.
  o Scalable vector extension (SVE) code may cause segmentation faults when
    PAT_RT_CALLSTACK_MODE is set to 'unwind'

 Dependencies:
 =============
 o A PDF reader (such as evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
   app2 online help.
 o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
   Perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
   release announcements.

Sanitizers4hpc 1.0.4:
=========================

Release Date:
--------------
  November 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
Sanitizers4hpc is a debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
and errors in parallel applications. Using LLVM's AddressSanitizer or
LeakSanitizer as a data source, Sanitizers4hpc aggregates any duplicate
messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
program behavior.

Changelog:
---------
NOTE:
Shared library exposure in previous versions of sanitizers4hpc.

Previous versions of sanitizers4hpc incorrectly exported internal sanitizers4hpc
libraries into /opt/cray/pe/lib64, causing other programs that had that path in
their runpath or LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load libraries they didn't expect.

This has been fixed in the 22.08 release of sanitizers4hpc. However, links will
be present in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing to older versions of sanitizers4hpc,
if an older version is installed because old installations will still modify /opt/cray/pe/lib64 when ldconfig is run.

To clean up libraries left by previous versions of sanitizers4hpc:
Option 1:
  1. Uninstall all previously installed versions of sanitizers4hpc, or remove
     the .cray_dynamic_file_list file from all previously installed versions
     of sanitizers4hpc, typically installed in /opt/cray/pe/sanitizers4hpc.
  2. Remove any links in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing into a sanitizers4hpc installation.
  3. run ldconfig
Option 2:
  1. Uninstall all previous versions of santizers4hpc.
