Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.5:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  August 2021


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Purpose:
---------
  This release includes the following new features and bugfixes:
    - Full support for CPU and GPU kernel debugging on AMD GPUs
      using the ROCm runtime.
    - Support analysis of binaries built with PGI and Intel compilers.
      Note: there is a known issue with corefile generation for Intel-
      built binaries. If corefile support is desired, set
      ATP_GDB_BINARY to the path to your system's GDB binary.

==============

Release Date:
-------------
    September  2021

Purpose:
--------
   - Enable Intel module generation inside a chroot. 
 
Dependencies:
-------------
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.18 release is supported on the following Cray
    systems running Cray Linux Environment (CLE) operating system:
    o   Cray XC/XE/XK systems with CLE version 5.2 or later.
 
    Driver support for integrating Third Party C, C++, and Fortran libraries
    through .pc files using pkg-config is used in CrayPE 2.x and later


Limitation:
-----------
    o  Library dependencies for static libraries are not added to the .pc files
       for keywords Requires.private and Libs.private. A warning is issued by 
       the craypkg-gen tool to advise users to add this information to the 
       libraries .pc files.
    o  RPM limits packages to 4GB
 
Documentation:
--------------
    Man pages for craypkg-gen are found by executing ‘module load craypkg-gen’ 
    and then ‘man craypkg-gen’ See 
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config 
    introduction.
 
    Examples for creating modulefiles for Intel, PGI and Python are included in
    the craypkg-gen ‘doc’ directory:
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.18/doc/intel_example.txt
        /opt/cray/craypkg-gen/1.3.18/doc/pgi_example.txt

Example:
      As an example, the Intel 16.0.3.210 compiler was recently released.  
      After installing the compiler the administrator creates a modulefile for
      this release by executing the following commands:                   
 
               # module load craypkg-gen
               # craypkg-gen -m /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210
 
        This version of the Intel compiler is made default by executing the 
        command:
               # /opt/admin-pe/set_default_craypkg/set_default_intel_16.0.3.210
 
Installation instructions:
--------------------------

Product description:
    The craypkg-gen 1.3.18 utility provides the system administrator
    a tool to integrate third party software with the Cray software stack. 
    Craypkg-gen assists with integration by creating .pc files for C, C++, and
    Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs. 

    The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
        1) Build the open source software
        2) Create .pc files for libraries
        3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
        4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
        5) Package rpms
        6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

    - HPE Apollo systems with Slurm and RH 8.0 or later
    - Baymax systems with RH 8.0 or later

  Product Dependencies:
     - Cray cray-cti rpm installed
     - Cray cray-cdst-support rpm installed

  NOTE: There are missing dependencies that cause stat-view to not work on some installations, 
        it will show up a failure to load xdot.py
     - The simplest work-around is to load cray-stat 4.7.x or older to run stat-view.
     - Or arrange to have the following packages installed: 
        python3-gobject, python3-gobject-Gdk, python3-cairo, python3-numpy and make sure
        an openblas module is loaded if available.

Perftools 21.09.0
===============
 Release Date: September 02, 2021

 Purpose:
 ========
   This is a feature and bugfix release for Cray XC, Cray CS, HPE Apollo 80, 
   HPE Apollo 2000 Gen10 Plus (x86), and HPE Cray EX supercomputer (Shasta) 
   systems. This version of perftools supports CLE 7 on Cray XC systems, 
   RHEL/CentOS 8 on Cray CS and HPE Apollo systems, and V1.3 and V1.4 on Shasta.

 Important note:
 ===============
  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS WILL FAIL (see details below).

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o PAPI 6.0.0.9 (upstream bugfixes, Intel Icelake support (but no PAPI presets), 
    cray_pm support of COS v1.5, cray_rapl and cray_zenl3 components for AMD 
    processors with MSR Safe kernel module, cray_cassini component for Cassini NIC)
  o DWARF 21.2.0 (upstream bugfixes, extended support for DWARF5) 
  o Update trace group wrappers to support BLAS v3.10.0
  o Update trace group wrappers to support LAPACK v3.10.0
  o CrayPat runtime support for Intel Icelake (basic counter groups and derived metrics)
  o CrayPat runtime support for AMD RAPL counters and any x86 platform that configures 
    MSR Safe kernel module correctly
  o CrayPat runtime support for AMD Level 3 cache counters (no counter groups and no 
    derived metrics) and any x86 platform that configures MSR Safe kernel module correctly
  o PAPI and CrayPat support for ROCm 4.3.0
  o aocc/3.0.0 support
  o OpenMP target offload support for AMD GPUs
  o cce/12.0.1 fix for OpenMP target codes (cce/12.0.0 breaks perftools tracing 
    with C/C++ OpenMP target offload codes)
  o Shasta v1.5 support
  o Inline functions are now marked with 'I' within pat_report text reports
  o Improve time to generate perftools-lite-loops text report 

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this. 
    Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 
    release.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using 
    perftools with OpenMP codes.  Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used 
    in this situation.
  o Some codes may not show user functions in pat_report when using the intel or 
    gcc compilers. This is caused by problems with the dwarf being generated. In 
    this case, users should add '-finstrument-functions' to their compiler flags, 
    and rebuild. This will be addressed in a future release of perftools.
  o On machines with AMD GPUs, some applications may fail to link due to 
    'cannot find -lcupti', even when cuda is not installed, and there are no Nvidia 
    GPUs on the machine. There is no workaround. This will be addressed in a future 
    release of perftools.
  o Some applications built with gcc/11.2.0 may fail to produce usable experiment 
    directories on SLES-based machines.  The workaround is to use gcc/10.3.0.  
    This will be addressed in a future release of perftools.

 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o Correct default counter group for Intel Skylake processors.
  o Fixed pre-req so Perftools-lite-loops module can load properly.
  o Fix pat_report crash when processing a large call tree.
  o Fix segfault with lite-gpu and full trace when using NVIDIA GPUs

 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.
