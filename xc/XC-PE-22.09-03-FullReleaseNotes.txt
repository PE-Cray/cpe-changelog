Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.13:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

- Bug Fixes
- SVE support (beta)

------------
CCE 14.0.2:
- Bug Fixes
- AMD ROCm 5.2 support
- Support for generating native GPU floating-point atomic add instructions for "omp atomic"
  constructs
- Support for the "-m[no-]unsafe-fp-atomics" compiler flag (C, C++, and Fortran) for
  controlling native floating-point atomic generation on AMD MI250X GPUs

------------
CCE 14.0.1:
- Bug Fixes

------------
CCE 14.0.0:
- LLVM 14 base
- C++17 support
  - Note: libstdc++ (and associated C++ library headers) updated from GCC 8.1.0
    to 10.3.0. Recommend C++ objects be recompiled to avoid ABI incompatibilities.
- SVE support (beta)
- AMD ROCm 5.0 and 5.1 support
- Tuned Fortran AMDGPU loop unrolling heuristic
- Optimized OpenMP "device scope" atomics/fences
- Complete support for AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer (incl. Archer) for
  C/C++ programs (CPU only), enabled using the command line option

    -fsanitize=address|thread

- Preliminary support for AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer (incl. Archer)
  for Fortran programs (CPU only), enabled using the command line option

    -fsanitize=address|thread

  Note that:
    - The option -g is required for AddressSanitizer
    - COMMON variables are not supported by AddressSanitizer currently

- Optimized OpenMP offload kernel launch performance
- CCE supports partial OpenMP 5.0. The following OpenMP 5.0 features
  have been added in this release for Fortran, C, and C++, unless noted otherwise.
  - task reductions (Fortran)
  - simd if (Fortran)
  - "requires unified_shared_memory" for AMD MI250X (Fortran)
- CCE supports partial OpenACC 2.6 and 3.0. The following OpenACC features
  have been added in this release for Fortran.
  - "if_present" clause on "update"
  - "acc_attach" and "acc_attach_async" APIs
  - "async" and "wait" on "acc data"
  - "if" clause on "acc wait"

User and Application Impact:
---------------------------
C++ applications built using CCE 13 or earlier may need to be recompiled due to the significant
changes that were necessary to implement C++17.  This is expected to be a one-time requirement.

Some non-standard Cray Fortran extensions supporting shorthand notation for logical operations
will be removed in a future release.  CCE 14 will issue warning messages when these are
encountered, providing time to adapt the application to use standard Fortran.

LibSci_ACC 20.10.1
==================

  Release Date:
  -------------
    October 2020

  Purpose and Misc:
  -----------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 provides accelerated versions of scientific
    libraries for Cray systems with GPU targets.

    This Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 release provides the following:

      Support for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.0

  Product and OS Dependencies:
  ----------------------------
    This Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 release requires the following:

      Cray XC systems with GPU support running CLE 7.0
      Cray CS systems with GPU support running latest PE supported OS

    This Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 release requires the following:

      CUDA Toolkit 11.0
      LibSci 17.11.1 or later
      CCE 10.0 or later
      GCC 8.1 or later
      PE supported MPI libraries

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    Cray LibSci_ACC 20.10.1 supports NVIDIA Tesla V100, P100, KXX targets.

    LAPACK workspace calculations from other implementations or hard-coded
    values may not be compatible with libsci_acc.  Workspaces reported from
    a query to the corresponding libsci_acc function should be used.

    The current supported usecase is a one-rank to one-gpu mapping for apps.

    Applications running PBLAS routines on the accelerator should set the
    environment variable MPICH_NO_GPU_DIRECT=1 to ensure correctness.

    Performance improvements can be achieved in programs calling libsci_acc
    subroutines by using pinned memory. See the intro_libsci_acc man page for
    details.

    Use of the aprun option "-cc none" or the srun option "--cpu_bind=none"
    to disable core affinity is strongly suggested to maintain performance.

    When using non-default cray-libsci_acc versions users should set equivalent
    at runtime and linktime after loading the desired cray-libsci_acc module:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    This version and previous versions of LibSci_ACC are not thread-safe.

  Documentation:
  --------------------------------
    See the intro_libsci_acc man page for additional information.

  Modulefile:
  -----------
    module load cray-libsci_acc

    For Cray CS systems:
      CCE 14 
      craype for CS
      MVAPICH2 or Intel MPI for CS


  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    OMP threaded versions:
    The CrayPE 2.1.2 and later releases add support for link line generation
    for the multi-threaded versions of the libsci library based on the OpenMP
    flags the user specifies for each compiler:
    * CCE by default links to the OpenMP LibSci library. CrayPE will link in
      the serial version of LibSci when the CCE flag -hnoomp is used.
    * GNU by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the GNU flag -fopenmp is used.
    * INTEL by default links serial LibSci library. CrayPE will link in the
      OpenMP version of LibSci when the INTEL flag -qopenmp is used.

    Stack size limit:
    The 'ulimit -s unlimited' system stack size setting is required for
    cray-libsci on all supported Cray platforms. This is typically set as a
    system default by admin but may otherwise need to be set at runtime.

    QDWH and KSVD:
    These packages are currently included for CCE, GNU, and Intel compilers.

    Non-default dynamic linking:
    When using a non-default version of cray-libsci with dynamic linking
    users should set at runtime and at linktime after loading the desired
    cray-libsci module--or set the equivalent for their linux shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


  Documentation:
  --------------
    See the intro_libsci man page for additional information.

    See the csmlversion man page for information to display version information
    on the currently loaded scientific libraries.


  Modulefile:
  -----------

Purpose:
--------
    The following new features has been added to Cray MPT 7.7.20 since
    the Cray MPT 7.7.19 release:

        -. Support for CCE 14.0.  Note that CCE 14.0 declares itself
           to be incompatible with previous versions for C++ support,
           thus cray-mpich/7.7.20 is incompatible with previous versions
           of CCE.

        - New 3rd party software support
          - Intel OneAPI 2022.1.2
          - Allinea 22.0.0.1
          - Nvidia SDK 22.2
          - Support for CUDA 11.6

    Additional Cray MPICH changes:

        - Miscellaneous internal build changes

    Additional Cray SHMEM changes:

        - Miscellaneous internal build changes


    The following bugs have been fixed since the Cray MPT 7.7.17 releases:

    Cray MPICH
        - No new bug fixes

    Cray SHMEM
        - No new bug fixes


    PLEASE NOTE:
       Cray MPICH:
           - GNU compiler support does not include Fortran 2008 language
             bindings support for Cray MPICH.

           - The Allinea 21.0 compiler (first supported in this release
             MPT 7.7.18) is ABI incompatible with previous Allinea
             compilers.  If an older Alliena compiler is desired an older
             MPT must be used.


       Cray SHMEM:
           - Cray SHMEM is not supported for aarch64.  Please use Cray
             OpenSHMEMX instead.

MRNET 5.0.4
===============

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  MRNet is a customizable, high-performance software infrastructure for
  building scalable tools and applications.  It supports efficient 
  multicast and data aggregation functionality using a tree of processes 
  between the tool's front-end and back-ends.  MRNet-based tools may use 
  these internal processes to distribute many important tool activities, 
  for example to reduce data analysis time and keep tool front-end loads 
  manageable.

  MRNet-based tool components communicate across logical channels called
  streams. At MRNet internal processes, filters are bound to these streams to
  synchronize and aggregate dataflows. Using filters, MRNet can efficiently
  compute averages, sums, and other more complex aggregations and analyses
  on tool data. MRNet also supports facilities that allow tool developers
  dynamically load new tool-specific filters into the system.

Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
  For certain F77 source files, when compiling with gcc/10 & gcc/11, it may be necessary
  to configure/compile with:
      export FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
      export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"

  This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.
  See:
      https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/212
      https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html

  Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
  decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
  changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
  provided.

  NetCDF is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator.

    The Cray Trilinos 12.18.1.1 release requires the following software products:

    For Cray XC series systems:
      CrayPE 2.1.2 or later
      cray-libsci 16.03.1 or later
      TPSL 20.03.2
      MPT 7.7.0 or later
      NetCDF 4.7.4.*
      HDF5 1.12.0.*

      One or more of the following major compiler versions:
        Cray Clang 9.0 or later
        GCC 8.2 or later
        Intel 19 or later

  Notes and Limitations:
  ----------------------
    Cray Trilinos 12.18.1.1 release does not currently support the
    Cray Classic C and C++ compilers.

    When using Cray Trilinos 12.18.1.1 with PrgEnv-intel, users must load
    a gcc module >= 4.9.0 for C++11 support.  See Bug 836679.

    The Trilinos packages "Mesquite", "Sundance", and "ForTrilinos"
    are no longer supported upstream, or are very experimental, and
    are not supported in Cray Trilinos 12.18.1.1.

    Users may experience delays when linking against Cray Trilinos
    12.18.1.1 with some compilers/linkers (e.g. CAST-23025).  Users
    should consider using the GOLD or LLD linkers in this case.

       the craypkg-gen tool to advise users to add this information to the
       libraries .pc files.
   - RPM limits packages to 4GB

Documentation
-------------
   Man pages for craypkg-gen are found by executing `module load craypkg-gen`
   and then `man craypkg-gen`. See
   http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config for a pkg-config
   introduction.

   Fortran libraries, pkg-config enabled modulefiles and RPMs.

   The workflow for using craypkg-gen is
   1) Build the open source software
   2) Create .pc files for libraries
   3) Create pkg-config enabled modulefiles
   4) Customize pkg-config and modulefiles if needed
   5) Package rpms
   6) Install the rpms on the Cray system

gdb4hpc 4.14.3:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  August 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  gdb4hpc is a GDB-based parallel debugger used to debug applications compiled with
  CCE, AOCC, GNU, and Intel Fortran, C and C++ compilers. It allows programmers to
  either launch an application or attach to an already running application that
  was launched on the system. Additionally, it provides comparative debugging
  technology that enables programmers to compare data structures between two
  executing applications. Comparative debugging should be used in conjunction
  with the CCDB GUI tool accessed by loading the cray-ccdb module.

  Some features of gdb include:

  * Command line parallel debugger allows for launching/attaching applications.

  * Utilizes process sets to operate on a subset of application ranks.

  * GDB-like feel, also implements a gdbmode to enable a true parallel gdb.

  * GPU debugging is supported for OpenMP 4.0+ GPU directives; OpenMP 5.0 on AMD
      and Nvidia GPU's.

  * Workload manager support via Common Tools Interface (cray-cti).

Release Date:
-------------
  June 2020

Product Description:
--------------------
  IOBUF is an I/O buffering library that can reduce the I/O wait time
  for programs that read or write large files sequentially. IOBUF
  intercepts I/O system calls such as read and open and adds a layer of
  buffering, thus improving program performance by enabling asynchronous
  prefetching and caching of file data.

Purpose:
--------
  The following bugs are fixed in the iobuf 2.0.10 release.
    CAST-7645  can load multiple iobuf module versions
    CAST-19029 cray iobuf fwrite does not work
    CAST-20732 Out of memory caused by fflush+close instead of fclose

Known problems:
---------------
  The iobuf "direct" option causes Fortran sequential, unformatted I/O 
  to fail on CLE 5.0 and later systems.  For more information,
  please see PE-15003, "Fortran sequential writes fail with 
  IOBUF direct option on Lustre 2.x".

Operating System Dependencies:
------------------------------
  The IOBUF release is supported on 
  - Cray XC systems running CLE 6.0 or later operating systems
  - Cray Shasta systems

Sanitizers4hpc 1.0.1:
=========================

Release Date:
--------------
  July 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
Sanitizers4hpc is a debugging tool to aid in the detection of memory leaks
and errors in parallel applications. Using LLVM's AddressSanitizer or
LeakSanitizer as a data source, Sanitizers4hpc aggregates any duplicate
messages across ranks to help provide an understandable picture of
program behavior.

Changelog:
---------
NOTE:
Shared library exposure in previous versions of sanitizers4hpc.

Previous versions of sanitizers4hpc incorrectly exported internal sanitizers4hpc
libraries into /opt/cray/pe/lib64, causing other programs that had that path in
their runpath or LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load libraries they didn't expect.

This has been fixed in the 22.08 release of sanitizers4hpc. However, links will
be present in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing to older versions of sanitizers4hpc,
if an older version is installed because old installations will still modify /opt/cray/pe/lib64 when ldconfig is run.

To clean up libraries left by previous versions of sanitizers4hpc:
Option 1:
  1. Uninstall all previously installed versions of sanitizers4hpc, or remove
     the .cray_dynamic_file_list file from all previously installed versions
     of sanitizers4hpc, typically installed in /opt/cray/pe/sanitizers4hpc.
  2. Remove any links in /opt/cray/pe/lib64 pointing into a sanitizers4hpc installation.
  3. run ldconfig
Option 2:
  1. Uninstall all previous versions of santizers4hpc.
