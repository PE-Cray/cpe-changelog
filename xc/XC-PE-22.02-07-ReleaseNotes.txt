Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) 3.14.9:
================================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Abnormal Termination Processing (ATP) is a system that
  monitors user applications, and should an application
  take a system trap, ATP preforms analysis on the dying
  application. All of the stack backtraces of the
  application processes are gathered into a merged
  stack backtrace tree and written to disk as the file
  "atpMergedBT.dot". The stack backtrace for the first process
  to die is sent to stderr as is the number of the signal that
  caused the death. If the core file size limit (RLIMIT_CORE)
  is non-zero, a heuristically selected set of processes dump
  their core.

  atpMergedBT.dot can be viewed with 'statview', a component
  of the STAT package (module load stat).  The merged stack
  backtrace tree provides a concise, yet comprehensive, view
  of what the application was doing at the time of its death.

Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) 2.15.9:
======================================

Release Date:
--------------
  January 2022


Product Description:
--------------------
  Cray Common Tools Interface (CTI) is a library that abstracts debugger
  tool support to a common interface regardless of the underlying work
  load manager. It facilitates the staging of files and the launch of
  tool daemons on the compute nodes associated with a parallel job.
  Options and interfaces can be found in the cti(1) and cti(3) manpages.

Purpose:
---------
  22.02 This release is a bugfix release:
      - Default Shasta PALS node count in job launches to 1
      - Include `--overlap` in Slurm tool daemon launches for Slurm versions
        20.11 and above

  21.12 This release adds the following features:
      - Added user documentation manpage cti(1), and developer
        documentation manpage cti(3).
      - Preliminary support for the Flux workload manager.
        Note that passwordless SSH access to compute nodes must be
        configured for Flux support. This limitation will be
        removed in a future release.
      - Flux, Shasta PALS, and ALPS support can be disabled at
        compile-time if development headers are not available.
      - Updated gen compilers to cray-gcc-10.3.0

  21.11 This bugfix release resolves the following issues:
      - Fix potential deadlock during job launch / attach for HPCM PALS systems,
        as well as the generic SSH interface
      - Fix Slurm job attach when running on compute node where hostname does
        not match the Slurm node name
      - Add environment variable CTI_SLURM_DAEMON_GRES to set the --gres
        for Slurm daemon launches. For Slurm versions 21.08 and newer, this
        should be set to an empty string (see SchedMD bug)
        https://bugs.schedmd.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12642

Notes and Limitations:
----------------------
    For certain F77 source files, when compiling with gcc/10 & gcc/11, it may be necessary
    to configure/compile with:
        export FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch"
        export FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch" 

    This will turn mismatch errors between actual and dummy argument lists to warnings.
    See: 
       https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/212  
       https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html   
    
    Unidata now packages Netcdf-4 and legacy Netcdf-3 separately. Cray has
    decided not to continue supplying the legacy Netcdf-3 package. Due to CCE
    changes a version of netcdf built with "-sreal64" is neither needed nor
    provided.

    NetCDF is supported on the host CPU but not on the accelerator.

  When cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later) is installed on a system, 
  ALL VERSIONS OF PERFTOOLS PRIOR TO 21.09.0 WILL FAIL. 
    After installing cpe-gcc-11.2.0 or cray-gcc-11.2.0 (or later), all Perftools 
    versions prior to Perftools-21.09.0 will fail. There is no workaround for this; 
    perftools-21.09.0 later must be used. Cpe-gcc-11.2.0 and cray-gcc-11.2.0 are 
    installed as part of the Cray PE-21.09 and later releases.

 Key enhancements or changes from the previous release:
 ======================================================
  o PAPI 6.0.0.12 - upstream bugfixes, built with ROCM 4.5.0
  o LIBDWARF 0.2.1 - upstream bugfixes and features, more complete DWARF5 support 
  o ROCm/4.5 support
  o Support for intel/2021.4
  o Support for Nvidia-sdk/21.9 for Everest
  o Support for cce/13.0.0
  o Support for AMD MI200 and AMD Trento
  o Cray-libelf version dependency changed to 0.8.14
  o Consolidate inline function data to reduce the size of AP2 files.
  o Reduced AMD GPU Hardware Performance Counter collection overhead. When collecting 
    HWPCs for AMD GPUs, accelerator kernels are serialized by default. This behavior 
    is controlled via the AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL option, which may be set to 0 if
    kernel serialization is not desired. Please see the accpc manpage for more details.

 Known Issues:
 ============= 
  o Perftools cannot generate accurate trace intercept wrappers for CCE Fortran 12.0 
    and later. This is a result of misleading DWARF debug information issued by 
    CCE Fortran 12.0 and later. This issue affects any trace experiment that attempts 
    to generate trace intercept wrappers for user-defined functions, including 
    'perftools-lite-events', 'perftools-lite-gpu', 'pat_build -u', 'pat_build -t', 
    and 'pat_build -T'. 
    The symptom is often a runtime segmentation fault, however, it is also possible 
    for the instrumented program to execute successfully, yet produce invalid or 
    misleading results. C and C++ are not affected. Sampling experiments are not 
    affected. This issue occurs in all versions of CCE Fortran 12.x, 13.0.0, 
    and 13.0.1. A fix will be provided in a future release of CCE.
    The workaround is to add -hfunc_trace to all fortran compilations.
  o Perftools-lite-loops does not work with cce/11.0.1. 
    Use cce/11.0.0 or 11.0.2 or later instead.
  o Nvidia OpenMP target offload does not work with CCE 11. 
    Compile your application with -fno-cray-omp-target-debug to use
    CCE 11 with OpenMP target offload.  The issue is fixed in CCE 12.
  o Affinity problems may occur on XC systems running PBS when using 
    perftools with OpenMP codes. Ensure that 'aprun -cc depth' is used 
    in this situation.

 CAST Bugs Fixed:
 ================
  o CAST-27322 pat_build - two versions of libsci are linked in
     
 Bugs Fixed:
 ===========
  o 'papi_native_avail' segfault fixed by Papi 6.0.0.12.
  o Correctly report PEs per node on EX systems.
  o Fix segfault during Perftools-lite report generation with GCC compiled codes.
  o Fix for some user functions not showing in pat_report with GCC or Intel 
    compiled codes.
  o Force serialization of HIP kernels when collecting counters, to prevent 
    excessive overhead.
  o Properly handle inlined functions that were previously rejected as having 
    invalid address ranges.

 Dependencies:
 =============
  o A PDF reader (evince, acroread or okular) is required to use the 
    app2 online help.
  o For a list of software used when validating this version of 
    perftools on Cray and HPE systems, see the HPE Cray Programming Environment
    release announcements.
